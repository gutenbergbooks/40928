LOST IN THE POST.</h2>


<p>Many a true tale has been told of the disappearance of money in
passing through the post. Sometimes the loss is never cleared up, but
remains a mystery to the end. One of these losses happened to us,
and the circumstances were so curious that they would have puzzled a
bench of judges. It was a regular mystery, and could not be accounted
for in any way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you chanced to read the first series of these papers, it may
scarcely be necessary to recall certain points to your recollection&mdash;that
Mr. Todhetley, commonly called the Squire, had two estates. The
chief one, Dyke Manor, lay on the borders of Worcestershire and
Warwickshire, partly in both counties; the other, Crabb Cot, was a
smaller place altogether, and much nearer Worcester. Sometimes we
stayed at one place, sometimes at the other. By an arrangement with
Mr. Brandon, my guardian and the trustee to my property, I, Johnny
Ludlow, lived with the Todhetleys. Mrs. Todhetley, the Squire&rsquo;s
present wife, was my stepmother, my father having married her after
my own mother&rsquo;s death. After my father&rsquo;s death&mdash;which took place
speedily&mdash;she became the second wife of Squire Todhetley, and the
stepmother of his only son and heir, Joseph. Two children were
subsequently born to them, Hugh and Lena, to whom Joseph was of
course half-brother. Joseph, unlike myself, had been old enough to
resent the advent of a stepmother when she came. Indulged and
haughty, he did not like the gentle control she brought; though she
was good as gold, as loving to him as he would let her be, and kind to
everybody. I don&rsquo;t say but that she was tall and thin as a lamp-post,
with a mild face, given to having aches in it, scanty light hair, and
kindly blue eyes; so she had not much to boast of in the way of
appearance. Joe and I grew up together like brothers. He was
several years the elder, and domineered over me absolutely. At school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
he was always called &ldquo;Tod;&rdquo; and I fell into the same habit. Perhaps
that is sufficient explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t come back to-night, you had better send me a
five-pound note in a letter,&rdquo; said Mrs. Todhetley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied the Squire.</p>

<p>This was said on the platform of Timberdale Station. We were
staying at Crabb Cot, and were taking the train at Timberdale instead
of that at South Crabb. The Squire was going to Worcester, and was
taking Tod and myself with him. It was a fine morning in April, and
Mrs. Todhetley and little Hugh had come with us through the Ravine
for the sake of the walk. Our returning at night, or not, was left an
open question, contingent upon the Squire&rsquo;s business at Worcester being
over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring me a whip, and a new bird-cage for my thrush, and a pot of
marmalade, papa,&rdquo; called out Hugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else would you like, sir?&rdquo; retorted the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bring &rsquo;em, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say!&rdquo; said Tod.</p>

<p>The train puffed off, drowning Hugh&rsquo;s further commands. We saw
him throw his cap at the train, and Mrs. Todhetley holding him back
from running after it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That young gentleman wants to be sent to school,&rdquo; remarked the
Squire. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you two boys make him worse than he would be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We reached Worcester about twelve, and went to the Star and
Garter. The Squire had no end of matters on hand that day: but the
two chief things that had brought him to Worcester were&mdash;to draw
some money from the bank, and to negotiate with Mr. Prothero, a
corn-dealer, for the sale of a load of wheat. Mr. Prothero was a close
man to deal with: he wanted the wheat at one price, the Squire said it
should only go at another: if he held out, the Squire meant to hold
out, even though it involved staying the night in Worcester.</p>

<p>It was Wednesday; market-day. Not so large a market as the
Saturday&rsquo;s, but the town looked pretty full. The first thing the Squire
did was to go to the Old Bank. At the door he turned round and said
there was no need for three of us to crowd into the place. However,
we were then inside, and so went on with him.</p>

<p>He had something particular to say to Mr. Isaac, and asked for him.
They were talking together in private for a minute or two, and then the
Squire took out his cheque for fifty pounds, and laid it on the counter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How will you take it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Isaac.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In five-pound notes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Isaac brought the money himself. The Squire put it in his
pocket-book, and we said good-morning, and departed. There were
shops to call at and people to see: and of course the market to walk
through. You wouldn&rsquo;t get the Squire to keep himself out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
market-house, when in Worcester on market-day: he&rsquo;d go about
asking the price of butter and fowls like any old woman. A little
after four o&rsquo;clock we got back to the Star; and found Mr. Prothero
had not made his appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just like him!&rdquo; cried the Squire. &ldquo;His appointment was for four
o&rsquo;clock sharp. He means to hold out against my price; that&rsquo;s what
he thinks to do. Let him! he won&rsquo;t get the wheat at less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d see him a jolly long way before he should have it at all,&rdquo; said
haughty Tod. &ldquo;Do you hear, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, Joe,&rdquo; was the Squire&rsquo;s answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway, sir, Prothero gives you more trouble than all the rest of
the buyers put together. He&rsquo;s a stingy, close-fisted fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But his money&rsquo;s safe and sure. Prothero is a respectable man,
Joe; his word&rsquo;s as good as his bond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half-past four, and no Prothero. The Squire began to fume a
little: if he hated one thing more than another it was to be kept waiting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, boys, I&rsquo;ll send that note to your mother,&rdquo; he said,
taking out his pocket-book. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much chance of our going
home to-night at this rate. Ring, one of you, for some paper and
envelopes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Separating one of the notes from the roll Mr. Isaac had handed to
him, he gave it to me to put up. I asked him if I should take down
the number.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it matters, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I took it down, perhaps through some unconscious instinct&mdash;for
I don&rsquo;t suppose I am more cautious than other people. In my pocket
was a letter from Anna Whitney: and I pencilled on it the number of
the note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Write inside the envelope &lsquo;Not home till to-morrow,&rsquo;&rdquo; growled
the Squire, forgetting that it could not be there till the morning. But
he was in an ill-humour.</p>

<p>I wrote it at his bidding, enclosed the bank-note, and addressed the
letter to Mrs. Todhetley at Crabb Cot. Tod and I went out to post it,
and began laying plans as to how we should spend the evening at
Worcester.</p>

<p>The post-office is not far from the Star, as everybody knows: and
though we met a fellow who used to go to school with us, a doctor&rsquo;s
son, and stayed talking with him, not ten minutes elapsed before we
were back again. And behold in that short time there was a change
in the programme. Old Prothero had been in, the bargain about the
wheat was concluded, and the Squire intended to start for home as
soon as dinner was over. Tod resented the change.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny and I were going to that advertised <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">séance</i>&mdash;or whatever
they call the thing&mdash;on electro-biology, sir. It will be first-rate fun,
they say.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Very sorry for you and Johnny. You&rsquo;ll have to go home instead.
Prothero has bought the wheat: and that&rsquo;s all I should have had to
stay here for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At his own price!&rdquo; cried Tod, rather mockingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Joe; at mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s an awful sell for us,&rdquo; grumbled Tod. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so often
we get a night at Worcester, that we should be done out of this
chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact is, I don&rsquo;t feel well,&rdquo; said the Squire, &ldquo;and should most
likely have gone home, whether Prothero had come in or not. I&rsquo;m
afraid I have caught cold, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was not any more to be said. The Squire&rsquo;s colds were no
joke: once he caught one, he would be downright ill; laid up for days.
We went back by rail to Timberdale, and took a fly home.</p>

<p>The next morning the Squire did not get up. Sure enough he had
a cold, and was feverish. At breakfast Mrs. Todhetley said one of us
should go over to South Crabb and ask Mr. Cole to call and see him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the pater hates doctors!&rdquo; exclaimed Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know he does,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But I feel sure that if he would
only take remedies for his colds in time, they would not be so bad as
they usually are, Joseph. Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; she added&mdash;for she was
seated where she could not see out, and had heard the gate click.</p>

<p>It was the postman: so I opened the glass doors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only one, sir,&rdquo; said he, handing me the letter we had posted at
Worcester the previous afternoon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Todhetley laughed as she opened it, saying it would have come
sooner had we brought it with us. Looking to see that the bank-note
was safe, she left it in the envelope on the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may as well get it changed for me at Salmon&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said,
handing it to Tod as we were going out, &ldquo;and then I need not disturb
your father. But you must make haste back, for you know I want the
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had no money in the house except a few shillings: and this was
why the note was to be posted to her if we stayed at Worcester. You
are often run short of money in rural country places: it&rsquo;s quite different
from town, where the banks are at hand.</p>

<p>We went through North Crabb, and met the doctor coming out at
his door. Tod told him the Squire wanted some physicking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caught a cold, has he?&rdquo; cried Cole. &ldquo;If he will only be reasonable
and keep himself warm in bed, we&rsquo;ll soon have that out of
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cole lived close upon South Crabb&mdash;I think I&rsquo;ve said so before. A
few yards beyond his house the shops began. Salmon&rsquo;s was the fifth
from the corner: a double shop, grocer&rsquo;s and draper&rsquo;s. The savings&rsquo;
bank was at Salmon&rsquo;s, and the post-office: he was the busiest tradesman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
in South Crabb, rather conceited over it, but very intelligent.
His brother was in business at Timberdale. This is what occurred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be good enough to change this five-pound note for me,
Mr. Salmon?&rdquo; said Tod, laying the note down on the grocer&rsquo;s counter,
on the left of the door, behind which Salmon stood, his grey hair carefully
brushed and a white apron on.</p>

<p>Salmon took the note up for a moment, and then unlocked the inner
drawer of his till, where he kept his gold. He was counting out the
five sovereigns when he paused; put them down, and picked up the
note again quickly. I had seen his eyes fall on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get this note from, sir?&rdquo; asked he of Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the Old Bank at Worcester.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s one of them notes that was lost in the robbery at
Tewkesbury, unless I&rsquo;m much mistaken,&rdquo; cried Salmon, beginning to
turn over the leaves of a small account-book that he fetched from the
post-office desk. &ldquo;Ay, I thought I was right,&rdquo; he adds, running his
finger across some figures on one of the pages. &ldquo;I had the numbers
correct enough in my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be out of your mind, Salmon,&rdquo; retorted Tod, in his defiant
way. &ldquo;That note was paid to my father yesterday at Worcester Old
Bank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it was, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it was! Why, I was present. I saw Mr. Isaac
count the notes out himself. Ten; and that was one of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Isaac never counted out this note,&rdquo; persisted Salmon.</p>

<p>He smoothed it out on the counter as he spoke. I had not noticed
it before: but it struck me now as I looked at it that it was <em>not</em> the
note I had put into the envelope at Worcester. That was a new, crisp
note; this was not crisp, and it looked a little soiled. Tod turned
passionate over it: he was just like the Squire in some things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand your behaviour, Salmon. I can swear that this
note was one given with the other nine at the bank yesterday, and
given by Mr. Isaac.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Salmon shook his head. As much as to say he knew to the contrary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better accuse Mr. Isaac of dealing in stolen notes&mdash;or me,&rdquo;
cried hot Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d neither of you be likely to deal in them, Mr. Todhetley.
There&rsquo;s a mistake somewhere. That&rsquo;s what it is. Mr. Isaac would be
too glad to get this note into his possession to pay it away again. No
people are more severe against money-robberies than bankers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Salmon talked, and Tod talked; but they could not agree. The
apprentice behind the counter on the drapery side listened with admiration,
evidently not knowing which side to take. I spoke then, saying
that the note did not appear to be the same as the one I had enclosed
in the letter; and Tod looked as though he could have knocked me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
down for saying it. I had changed my clothes and had not Anna
Whitney&rsquo;s letter with me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tod, it is of no use your taking it up in this way. If the thing is
so, it <em>is</em>. And it can soon be proved. I say I don&rsquo;t think it is the
same note, or the same numbers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had taken down the numbers of a bank-note, I could remember
what they were; so would any one but a muff, Johnny,&rdquo; said he, sarcastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember what they were. But I do seem to remember
that they were not these.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod flung out of the shop in a passion: to him it seemed impossible
that anything could be wrong with a note had direct from the bank.
As to its not being the same note, he scouted it utterly. Had it
dropped through the envelope and changed itself <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> from
Worcester? he sarcastically demanded&mdash;coming in again to ask it.</p>

<p>Salmon was quietly going over the circumstances of the Tewkesbury
robbery to me. About three weeks before, a butcher&rsquo;s shop was robbed
in Tewkesbury&mdash;the till carried off in open day. It had gold and silver
in it and two five-pound notes. The numbers of the notes happened
to be known, and notice of them was circulated, to put people on their
guard against taking them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Mr. Ludlow,&rdquo; said Salmon, showing me the numbers
of the stolen notes written down in his book, and comparing the one
with the bank-note we had taken to him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same, you see.
Reason&rsquo;s reason, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see how it&rsquo;s practicable,&rdquo; cried Tod, coming round
the least bit in the world, as he condescended to look himself at the
numbers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, neither do I&mdash;the facts being as you state them,&rdquo; acknowledged
Salmon. &ldquo;But here&rsquo;s the proof to stagger us, you observe.
It&rsquo;s in black and white.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be two notes with the same numbers,&rdquo; said Tod.</p>

<p>Salmon smiled: great in his assumption of superior knowledge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There never was yet, Mr. Todhetley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who numbers the notes, I wonder? I suppose mistakes are not
impossible to those who do it, any more than to other people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No fear of that, sir, with their system. The note has been changed
in the post.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; retorted Tod.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;d have cavilled until night, with no result, one holding out
against the other. Tod brought away the note and the five sovereigns&mdash;which
Salmon offered. We could send over another note at leisure,
he said. I examined the envelope after we had hastened home: it
was the same we had posted at Worcester, and did not appear to have
been tampered with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Getting Anna Whitney&rsquo;s letter out of my best clothes&rsquo; pocket, I
brought it to Tod. The numbers were quite different from the note&rsquo;s.
He stared like one bewildered: his eyes passing from those on the
letter to those on the note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny, this beats bull-baiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it did&mdash;for mystification.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you copied the figures correctly, old fellow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Tod! Of course I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go up to the pater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pater was getting up, in defiance of old Cole and Mrs. Todhetley,
and was dressed, up to his coat. He had a fire in his room and his
white night-cap on. I told him about the note. Tod was outside,
telling Mrs. Todhetley. He did not receive the news kindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The note I gave you to put into the envelope was one of those
stolen from the butcher at Tewkesbury! How dare you bring your
rubbishing stories to me, Mr. Johnny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tried to explain how it was&mdash;that it was not the same note; as the
numbers proved. He would hear nothing at first, only went on at me,
stamping his slippers and nodding his head, the big white tassel of the
night-cap bobbing up and down. If Salmon dared to say he had sent
him a stolen note to change, he&rsquo;d teach Salmon what slander meant
the next time the magistrates sat.</p>

<p>Tod came in then with Mrs. Todhetley. The Squire had talked
himself quiet, and I got a hearing: showing him the numbers I had
taken down outside Anna&rsquo;s letter and the numbers on the stolen bank-note.
It brought him to reason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, bless my heart! How can they have been changed,
Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking the packet of notes out of his pocket-book, he went over
their numbers. They were all consecutive, the nine of them; and so
was the tenth, the one I had taken down. He pushed his night-cap
back and stared at us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you two get larking yesterday and drop the letter on your way
to the post?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We took it straight to the post, sir, and put it safely in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;d answer for that,&rdquo; stormed the Squire.
&ldquo;Once dropped in the street, there&rsquo;s no knowing who might pick it up,
or what tricks might be played with it. Hold your tongues, you two.
How else do you suppose it could have been done? We don&rsquo;t live in
the days of miracles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Off went his night-cap, on went his coat. Ringing the bell, he
ordered the phaeton to be got ready on the instant, to take him to the
station: he was going to Worcester. Mrs. Todhetley quite implored
him not to go; as good as went down on her knees: he would
increase his cold, and perhaps be laid up. But he wouldn&rsquo;t listen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
&ldquo;Hang the cold!&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;he had no cold; it was gone. People
shouldn&rsquo;t have it to say that tricks could be played on him with
impunity, and stolen notes substituted for honest ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a way he puts himself into!&rdquo; laughed Tod, when he had
ordered us off to make ready.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know somebody else who does just the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get it presently, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Away we went to the station, Bob and Blister spanking along and
Tod driving; the Squire, wrapped in about a dozen rugs and comforters,
sitting beside him. The groom, Dwarf Giles, was behind with
me: he would have to take the carriage back again. A train came
up pretty soon, and we reached Worcester.</p>

<p>Of all commotions, the Squire made the worst. When he got to
the bank, Mr. Isaac was out: would not be in till three o&rsquo;clock: and
that put the finishing stroke to the pater&rsquo;s impatience. Next he went
to the Star, and told of the matter there, gathering half the house
about him. The post-office was taken next. They seemed to know
nothing whatever about the letter&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t think they did&mdash;had
not particularly noticed it in sorting: could not have seemed to see
less had they been in a fog at sea: except one thing, and that they&rsquo;d
swear to&mdash;that every letter posted at the office the previous day, and
all other days, had been duly forwarded, untampered with, to its
destination.</p>

<p>The first dawn of reason that fell over us was in the interview with
Mr. Isaac. It was pleasant to be with any one so cheerfully calm.
Taking the roll of five-pound notes in his hand, he pronounced them
to be the same he had given us on the previous day; and the number
I had dotted down to have been the one belonging to the tenth
note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is this one of those two stolen ones that were advertised?&rdquo;
demanded the Squire, putting it into Mr. Isaac&rsquo;s hands.</p>

<p>Mr. Isaac spoke with a clerk for a minute&mdash;perhaps referring to the
numbers as Salmon had done&mdash;and came back saying that it was the
note. So there we were: the matter laid, so far, to rest. Nothing
could be more unsatisfactory. The Squire sat quite still, as if he had
been struck dumb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I shall never see daylight out of this,&rdquo; cried the Squire,
in a sort of hopeless, mazy tone. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than conjuring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Isaac was called away. The Squire fastened upon one of the
old clerks, and went over the matter with him. He could not readily
understand it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The note must have been changed, Mr. Todhetley,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Changed in the post?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Changed somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who did it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire could not tear himself away. Once out of the bank he
would be nonplussed. He began casting a doubt on the Worcester
post-office; the clerk retorted that there was a post-office at our end,
Timberdale: and at that the Squire fired up. Each would have held
out for the good faith of his respective post-office to the death. It put
Tod and me in mind of the fable of the crows, each old mother saying
that her own crow was the whitest. After glaring at one another for
a bit through their spectacles, they shook hands and parted.</p>

<p>We arrived home to a late dinner at Crabb Cot, just as wise as we
had left it in the morning. The Squire had an awful cold, though he
wouldn&rsquo;t admit it. At nine o&rsquo;clock he virtually gave in, went up to
bed, and said Molly was to make him a basin of hot gruel, and we
might put a drop of brandy in it.</p>

<p>The mode of conveying the letters from Worcester was this. The
Timberdale bag, made up at the Worcester office, was brought out at
night by the late train, and dropped at the Timberdale Station. The
postmaster of Timberdale would be at the station to receive it, and
carry it home.</p>

<p>His name was Rymer. A man of acknowledged respectability in
the place, and of good connections, the son of a clergyman. He had
been brought up for a surgeon, but somehow never had the chance to
pass; and, years and years ago, opened a chemist and druggist&rsquo;s shop
at Timberdale. Then he added other things: stationery, Christmas
cards, valentines, boys&rsquo; marbles, purses, and such like, which his wife
attended to. In time he had the post-office. As to suspecting Rymer
of doing anything wrong with the note, it was not to be thought of.
He had two children: a son, who never seemed to do any good for
himself, and if placed away from home would return to it again: and a
daughter, a nice little girl of sixteen, who was as useful amidst the
drugs and the post-office work as her father.</p>

<p>Timberdale had two letter-carriers. One for the place itself, the
other for the country round. This last had a regular journey of it, for
the farm-houses were scattered. There had always been talk that our
two houses&mdash;the Squire&rsquo;s and old Coney&rsquo;s&mdash;ought not to be put in the
Timberdale district of delivery, and why it was originally done nobody
could make out; seeing that we were ever so far off Timberdale, and
in Crabb parish. But people did not bestir themselves to alter it, and
so the old custom went on. The country postman was Lee: a trustworthy
old soul with shaky legs.</p>

<p>The next morning, Cole the surgeon came in, vexed. The Squire
ought not to have got up at all the day before, he said, much less have
gone to Worcester; and where was the use of his prescribing remedies
if they were not attended to? Upon that, the Squire (after retorting
that he should do as he pleased in spite of Cole and his remedies, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
speaking in a sort of hoarse and foggy voice) told about posting the
bank-note to Mrs. Todhetley, and what had come of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a strange thing,&rdquo; said Cole, when he had turned the news
over in his mind. &ldquo;What do <em>you</em> think, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He would often say to me when talking of things and people, &ldquo;What
do <em>you</em> think?&rdquo; He had a theory that I saw more clearly than others,
just as Duffham at Church Dykely had. I had nothing particular to
think about this: it seemed a hopeless mystery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lee&rsquo;s sure,&rdquo; said Cole, speaking of the postman; &ldquo;so is Rymer.
It could have been in no other hands on this side the journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Worcester people say it was not tampered with on their side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you questioned Rymer about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; croaked the Squire. &ldquo;I meant to have gone to him to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which you will not do!&rdquo; cried Mr. Cole. &ldquo;But now, look here:
I wouldn&rsquo;t tell people at first that the exchanged note was one of those
stolen ones, if I were you: not even Rymer. No one likes to be
mixed up in robberies. You&rsquo;d put folks on their guard at once; and
any chance word of enlightenment, that might otherwise be dropped,
would be kept in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We did not quite take him. &ldquo;<em>I</em> would not,&rdquo; repeated Cole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we must inquire about it,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be said of
the note?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say that the bank-note you put in was changed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for
another one: that the numbers did not tally. That&rsquo;s all you need say
at first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod could not see any reason in the argument; but the Squire took
up the idea eagerly, and ordered Tod to do as was suggested. He was
unable to go to Timberdale himself, but was far too impatient to let it
rest until another day, and so Tod was to be his deputy.</p>

<p>With at least a hundred suggestions and injunctions from the Squire&mdash;who
only ceased when his voice disappeared completely&mdash;we set off,
taking the way of the Ravine. It was a fine spring day: the trees were
coming into leaf, the thorns and other bushes were budding: violets
and primroses nestled at their feet. I picked some early cowslips for a
ball for Lena, and some double white violets for Mrs. Todhetley.</p>

<p>Past Timberdale Court went we; past the church; past Jael Batty&rsquo;s
and the other straggling cottages, and came to the village street. It
was paved: and you can&rsquo;t say that of all villages.</p>

<p>Mr. Rymer was behind his counter: a thin, delicate-faced man, with
a rather sad expression and mild brown eyes. In spite of his poor
clothes and his white apron and the obscure shop he had served in for
twenty years, his face had &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; plainly stamped on it: but he
gave you the idea of being too meek-spirited; as if in any struggle with
the world he could never take his own part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The shop was a double shop, resembling Salmon&rsquo;s at South Crabb in
shape and arrangements. The drugs and chemicals were on the left-hand
side as you entered; the miscellaneous wares on the other. Horse
and cattle medicines were kept with the drugs: and other things too
numerous to mention, such as pearl barley, pickles, and fish-sauce.
The girl, Margaret Rymer, was serving a woman with a pennyworth of
writing-paper when we went in, and a postage-stamp. Tod asked for
Mr. Rymer.</p>

<p>He came forward from the little parlour, at one end of which was the
desk where he did his postal work.</p>

<p>Upon Tod&rsquo;s saying that we wished to speak with him privately, he
took us into the parlour. As we sat down opposite to him, I could not
help thinking what a nice face he had. It was getting very careworn.
A stranger would have given him more than his forty-five years: though
the bright brown hair was abundant still. Tod told his story. The
chemist looked thoroughly surprised, but open and upright as the day.
I saw at once that no fault attached to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bank-note exchanged as it passed through the post!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;But, Mr. Joseph Todhetley, the thing appears impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appears so,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;I was just as unwilling to believe it at
first: but facts are facts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot see the motive,&rdquo; said Rymer. &ldquo;Why should one bank-note
be taken out of a letter, if another were substituted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod looked at me. Wanting to say that the other was a stolen note,
and was no doubt put in to be got rid of. But the Squire had bound
us down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had the note been simply abstracted from the letter, we should be
at no loss to understand that a thief had helped himself to it; but a
thief would not put another note of the same value in its place,&rdquo; went
on Rymer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the facts are as I tell you, Mr. Rymer,&rdquo; returned Tod, impatient
at being trammelled and having to tell so lame a tale. &ldquo;One
bank-note was taken out of the letter and another put in its place. We
want you to help us unravel the mystery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will help you to the utmost of my power,&rdquo; was Rymer&rsquo;s answer.
&ldquo;But&mdash;are you sure you have told me the circumstances correctly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; answered Tod. &ldquo;The thing was done between
Worcester post-office and our house. How it was done, and by whom,
is the question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You enclosed the note in the letter yourself at Worcester on Wednesday
afternoon, and put it into the post-office: when we delivered
the letter at Crabb Cot yesterday morning, you found the note inside
had been taken out and another put in? These are the circumstances?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely so. Except that it was not I who enclosed the note and
took down its number, but Johnny Ludlow. The Worcester office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
disclaims all knowledge of the matter, and so we are thrown on this
side of the journey. Did you go to the station yourself for the letter-bag,
Rymer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, sir. I brought it home and sorted the letters at that desk,
ready for the two men to take out in the morning. I used to sort all
the letters in the morning, London and others: but lately I&rsquo;ve done
what we call the local bags&mdash;which come in before bed-time&mdash;at night.
It saves time in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you recollect noticing the letter for Crabb Cot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I noticed it. Yes, I feel sure I did. You see, there&rsquo;s
often something or other for you, so that it&rsquo;s not remarkable. But I
am sure I did notice the letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one could have got to it in the night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;here?&rdquo; exclaimed Rymer, opening his eyes in surprise
that such a question should be put. &ldquo;No, certainly not. The letter-bags
are locked up in this desk, and I keep the key about me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you gave them as usual to Lee in the morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Rymer knitted his patient brow the least in the world, as if he
thought that Tod&rsquo;s pursuing these questions reflected some suspicion
on himself. He answered very meekly&mdash;going over the whole from
the first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I brought the Worcester bag in on Wednesday night, I was
at home alone: my wife and daughter happened to be spending the
evening with some friends, and the servant had asked leave to go out.
I sorted the letters, and locked them up as usual in one of the deep
drawers of the desk. I never unlocked it again until the last thing in
the morning, when the other letters that had come in were ready to go
out, and the two men were waiting for them. The letter would be in
Lee&rsquo;s packet, of course&mdash;which I delivered to him. But Lee is to be
depended on: he would not tamper with it. That is the whole history
so far as I am connected with it, Mr. Joseph Todhetley. I could not
tell you more if I talked till mid-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Thomas? Anything amiss with the letters?&rdquo; called
out a voice at this juncture, as the inner door opened, that shut out
the kitchen.</p>

<p>I knew it. Knew it for Mrs. Rymer&rsquo;s. I didn&rsquo;t like her a bit: and
how a refined man like Rymer (and he was so in all respects) could
have made her his wife seemed to me to be a seven days&rsquo; wonder.
She had a nose as long as from Timberdale to Crabb Ravine; and her
hair and face were red, and her flounces gaudy. As common a woman
as you&rsquo;d see in a summer&rsquo;s day, with a broad Brummagem accent.
But she was very capable, and not unkindly natured. The worst
Timberdale said of her was, that she had done her best to spoil that
ugly son of hers.</p>

<p>Putting her head, ornamented with yellow curl-papers, round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
door-post, she saw us seated there, and drew it away again. Her
sleeves were rolled up, and she had on a coarse apron; altogether was
not dressed for company. Letting the door stand ajar, she asked
again if anything was amiss, and went on with her work at the same
time: which sounded like chopping suet. Mr. Rymer replied in a curt
word or two, as if he felt annoyed she should interfere. She would not
be put off: strong-minded women never are: and he had to give her
the explanation. A five-pound bank-note had been mysteriously lost
out of a letter addressed to Mrs. Todhetley. The chopping stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stolen out of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes; it may be said so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why do you call it mysterious?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Rymer said why. That the bank-note had not, in one sense,
been stolen; since another of the same value had been substituted
for it.</p>

<p>Chop, chop, chop: Mrs. Rymer had begun again vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know who&rsquo;s to make top or tail of such a story as that,&rdquo;
she called out presently. &ldquo;<em>Has</em> anything been lost, or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I tell you, Susannah: a five-pound note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Forgetting her curl-papers and the apron, Mrs. Rymer came boldly
inside the room, chopping-knife in hand, and requested further enlightenment.
We told her between us: she stood with her back
against the door-post while she listened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do you say this took place, young gents?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Wednesday night, or Thursday morning. When the letter
reached us at breakfast-time, the job was done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She said no more then, but went back and chopped faster than ever.
Tod and I had got up to go when she came in again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The odd part about it is their putting in a note for the same
value,&rdquo; cried she. &ldquo;I never heard of such a thing as that. Why not
spend the other note, and make no bother over it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would be quite justified in doing so under the circumstances,
Mr. Todhetley,&rdquo; said the quieter husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned Tod, hotly&mdash;and all but said more than
he was to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s not ours; there, Mrs. Rymer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I know what I&rsquo;d say&mdash;if the chance was given me,&rdquo; returned
she, resenting Tod&rsquo;s manner. &ldquo;That the note found in the letter was
the one put into it at Worcester. Changed in the post! It does not
stand to reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; her husband was beginning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Thomas Rymer, that&rsquo;s what I <em>think</em>: and so would you, if
you had a grain of sense beyond a gander&rsquo;s. And now good-morning,
young gents: my pudding won&rsquo;t get done for dinner at this rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Rymer came with us through the shop to the door. I shook
hands with him: and Tod&rsquo;s nose went up in the air. But I think it
lies in what you see a man is, by mind and nature, whether he is your
equal, and you feel proud to think he is so&mdash;not in the fact of his
wearing an apron. There are some lords in the land I wouldn&rsquo;t half
care to shake hands with as I would with Thomas Rymer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you will pardon me for reverting to my first opinion, Mr.
Todhetley,&rdquo; he said, turning to Tod&mdash;&ldquo;but indeed I think there must
be some mistake. Mrs. Rymer may be right&mdash;that the note found in
the letter was the one put into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod flung away. The facts he had obstinately refused to believe at
first, he had so fully adopted now, that any other opinion offended him.
He was in a passion when I caught him up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think that the pater should have sent us there like two fools,
Johnny! Closing our mouths so that we could not speak the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rymer only three parts believes it. His wife not at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His wife be sugared! It&rsquo;s nothing to her. And all through the
suggestion of that precious calf, Cole. Johnny, I think I shall act on
my own judgment, and go back and tell Rymer the note was a stolen
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pater told us not to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stuff! Circumstances alter cases. He would have told it himself
before he had been with Rymer two minutes. The man&rsquo;s hands are
partly tied, you see; knowing only half the tale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, <em>I</em> won&rsquo;t tell him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody asked you. Here goes. And the Squire will say I&rsquo;ve
done right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rymer was standing at his door still. The shop was empty, and
there were no ears near. Tod lowered his voice, though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truth is, Mr. Rymer, that the note, substituted in the letter
for ours, was one of those two lost by the butcher at Tewkesbury. I
conclude you heard of the robbery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of those two!&rdquo; exclaimed Rymer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes: Salmon at South Crabb recognized it yesterday when we
were asking him to give change for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why not have told me this at once, Mr. Joseph?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the Squire and Cole, laying their wise heads together this
morning, thought it might be better not to let that get abroad: it
would put people on their guard, they said. You see now where the
motive lay for exchanging the notes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; said Mr. Rymer in his quiet way. &ldquo;But it is
very unaccountable. I cannot imagine where the treason lies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not on this side, seemingly,&rdquo; remarked Tod: &ldquo;The letter appears
to have passed through no one&rsquo;s hands but Lee&rsquo;s: and he is safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Safe and sure. It must have been accomplished at Worcester.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Or&mdash;in the railway train,&rdquo; he slowly added. &ldquo;I have heard of such
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better keep counsel at present as to the stolen note, Mr.
Rymer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will until you give me leave to speak. All I can do to assist in
the discovery is heartily at Squire Todhetley&rsquo;s service. I&rsquo;d transport
these rogues, for my part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We carried our report home&mdash;that the thing had not been, and
could not have been, effected on the Timberdale side, unless old Lee
was to be suspected: which was out of the question.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Time went on, and it grew into more of a mystery than ever. Not
as to the fact itself or the stolen note, for all that was soon known high
and low. The Worcester office exonerated itself from suspicion, as did
the railway letter-van. The van let off its resentment in a little private
sneering: but the office waxed hot, and declared the fraud must lie at
the door of Timberdale. And so the matter was given up for a bad
job, the Squire submitting to the loss of his note.</p>

<p>But a curious circumstance occurred, connected with Thomas Rymer.
And, to me, his behaviour had seemed almost curious throughout.
Not at that first interview&mdash;as I said, he was open, and, so to say,
indifferent then; but soon afterwards his manner changed.</p>

<p>On the day following that interview, the Squire, who was very
restless over it, wanting the thing to come to light in no time, sent
me again to Rymer&rsquo;s, to know if he had learned any news. Rymer
said he had not; and his manner was just what it had been the past
day. I could have staked my life, if necessary, that the man <em>believed</em>
what he said&mdash;that news must be looked for elsewhere, not at Timberdale.
I am sure that he thought it impossible that the theft could
have been effected after the letters came into his hands. But some
days later on, when the whole matter had been disclosed, and the
public knew as much about it as we did, the Squire, well of his cold,
thought he would have a talk with Rymer himself, went over, and took
me with him.</p>

<p>I shall not forget it. In Rymer&rsquo;s window, the chemical side, there
was a picture of a bullock eating up some newly-invented cattle-food
and growing fat upon it. It caught the Squire&rsquo;s eye. Whilst he
stopped to read the advertisement, I went in. The moment Rymer
saw me&mdash;his daughter called to him to come out of the parlour where
he was at dinner&mdash;his face turned first red, and then as pale as
death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Todhetley thought he would like to come and see you, Mr.
Rymer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he said, in an agitated sort of tone, and then he stooped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to put some jars closer together under the counter; but I thought he
knew how white he was, and wanted to hide it.</p>

<p>When the Squire came in, asking first of all about the new cattle-food,
he noticed nothing. Rymer was very nearly himself then, and
said he had taken the agency, and old Massock had ordered some of it.</p>

<p>Then they talked about the note. Rymer&rsquo;s tone was quite different
from what it had been before; though whether I should have noticed
it but for his white face I can hardly tell. That had made me notice
<em>him</em>. He spoke in a low, timid voice, saying no more than he was
obliged to say, as if the subject frightened him. One thing I saw&mdash;that
his hands trembled. Some camomile blows lay on a white paper
on the counter, and he began doing them up with shaky fingers.</p>

<p>Was his wife given to eavesdropping? I should have thought not&mdash;she
was too independent for it. But there she was, standing just
within the little parlour, and certainly listening. The Squire caught
sight of her gown, and called out, &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, Mrs. Rymer?&rdquo; upon
which she came forward. There was a scared look on her face also,
as if its impudence had shrunk out of it. She did not stay an instant&mdash;just
answered the Squire, and went away again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must come to the bottom of the business somehow, you know,
Rymer,&rdquo; concluded the Squire, as he was leaving. &ldquo;It would never
do to let the thief get off. What I should think is, that it must be the
same fellow who robbed the butcher&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; hastily interrupted Rymer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>No!</em> One of the gang, then. Any way, you&rsquo;ll help us all you
can. I should like to bring the lot to trial. If you get to learn anything,
send me word at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rymer answered &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and attended us to the door. Then the
Squire went back to the cattle-food; but we got away at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thomas Rymer breaks, Johnny, I think. He doesn&rsquo;t seem in
spirits somehow. It&rsquo;s hard for a man to be in a shop all day long,
from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end, and never have an hour&rsquo;s holiday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ever after this, when the affair was spoken of with Rymer, he showed
more or less the same sort of shrinking&mdash;as if the subject gave him
some terrible pain. Nobody but myself noticed it; and I only because
I looked out for it. I believe he saw I thought something; for when
he caught my eye, as he did more than once, his own fell.</p>

<p>But some curious circumstances connected with him have to be told
yet. One summer evening, when it was getting towards dusk, he came
over to Crabb Cot to see the Squire. Very much to the pater&rsquo;s surprise,
Rymer put a five-pound note into his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the money found?&rdquo; cried he, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, it is not found,&rdquo; said Rymer, in a subdued tone. &ldquo;It
seems likely to remain a mystery to the last. But I wish to restore it
myself. It lies upon my conscience&mdash;being postmaster here&mdash;that such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
a loss should have taken place. With three parts of the public, and
more, it is the Timberdale side that gets the credit of being to blame.
And so&mdash;it weighs heavily upon me. Though I don&rsquo;t see how I could
have prevented it: and I lie awake night after night, thinking it over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire stared for awhile, and then pushed back the note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, goodness, man!&rdquo; cried he, when his amazement let him
speak, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;d take the money from you! What in
the world!&mdash;what right have you to bear the loss? You must be
dreaming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should feel better satisfied,&rdquo; said poor Rymer, in his subdued
voice of pain. &ldquo;Better satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how do you think <em>I</em> should feel?&rdquo; stamped the Squire, nearly
flinging the note into the fire. &ldquo;Here, put it up; put it up. Why,
my good fellow, don&rsquo;t, for mercy&rsquo;s sake, let this bother take your senses
away. It&rsquo;s no more your fault that the letter was rifled than it was
mine. Well, this is a start&mdash;your coming to say this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went on, battling it out. Rymer praying him to take the note
as if he&rsquo;d pray his life away; the Squire accusing the other of having
gone clean mad, to think of such a thing. I happened to go into the
room in the middle of it, but they had not leisure to look at me. It
ended in Rymer&rsquo;s taking back the note: it could not have ended in
any other manner: the Squire vowing, if he did not, that he should go
before the magistrates for lunacy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get the port wine, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rymer declined to take any: his head was not accustomed to wine,
he said. The Squire poured out a bumper and made him drink it:
telling him he believed it was something of the kind his head wanted,
or it would never have got such a wild notion into it as the errand he
had come upon that evening.</p>

<p>A few minutes after Rymer had left, I heard the Squire shouting to
me, and went back to the room. He had in his hand a little thin note-case
of green leather, something like two leaves folded together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rymer must have dropped this, Johnny, in putting it into his
pocket. The note is in it. You had better run after him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took it, and went out. But which way had Rymer gone? I could
see far along the solitary road, and it was light enough yet, but no one
was in view, so I guessed he was taking the short-cut through the
Ravine, braving the ghost, and I went across the field and ran down
the zigzag path. Wasn&rsquo;t it gloomy there!</p>

<p>Well, it was a surprise! Thinking himself alone, he had sat down
on the stump of a tree, and was sobbing with all his might: sobs that
had prevented his hearing me. There was no time for me to draw
back, or for him to hide his trouble. I could only hold out the green
case and make the best of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you are in some great trouble, Mr. Rymer?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>He got up and was quiet at once. &ldquo;The best of us have trouble at
times, Master Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Nothing. Except forget that you have seen me giving
way. It was very foolish of me: but there are moments when&mdash;when
one loses self-control.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Either through his awkwardness or mine, the leaves of the case
opened, and the bank-note fluttered out. I picked it up and gave it to
him. Our eyes met in the gloom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you know,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I suspect. Don&rsquo;t be afraid: no one else does: and I&rsquo;ll
never drop a hint to mortal man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Putting my hand into his that he might feel its clasp, he took it as it
was meant, and wrung it in answer. Had we been of the same age, I
could have felt henceforth like his brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be my death-blow,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Heaven knows I was
not prepared for it. I was unsuspicious as a child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went his way with his grief and his load of care, and I went
mine, my heart aching for him. I am older now than I was then: and
I have learnt to think that God sends these dreadful troubles to try us,
that we may fly from them to Him. Why else <em>should</em> they come?</p>

<p>And I dare say you have guessed how it was. The time came when
it was all disclosed; so I don&rsquo;t break faith in telling it. That ill-doing
son of Rymer&rsquo;s had been the thief. He was staying at home at the
time with one of the notes stolen from Tewkesbury in his possession:
some of his bad companions had promised him a bonus if he could
succeed in passing it. It was his mother who surreptitiously got the
keys of the desk for him, that he might open it in the night: he made
the excuse to her that there was a letter in the Worcester bag for himself
under a false direction, which he must secure, unsuspected. To
do Madam Rymer justice, she thought no worse: and it was she who
in her fright, when the commotion arose about the Tewkesbury note,
confessed to her husband that she had let Ben have the keys that night.
There could be no doubt in either of their minds after that. The son,
too, had decamped. It was to look for our letter he had wanted the
keys. For he knew it might be coming, with the note in it: he was
on the platform at Timberdale railway-station in the morning&mdash;I saw
him standing there&mdash;and must have heard what Mrs. Todhetley said.
And that was the whole of the mystery.</p>

<p>But I would have given the money from my own pocket twice over,
to have prevented it happening, for Thomas Rymer&rsquo;s sake.</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>


<h2><span class="f9">II.</span><br />

A LIFE OF TROUBLE.</h2>


<p>Mrs. Todhetley says that you may sometimes read a person&rsquo;s fate in
their eyes. I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s true. She holds to it that when
the eyes have a sad, mournful expression naturally, their owner is sure
to have a life of sorrow. Of course such instances may be found: and
Thomas Rymer&rsquo;s was one of them.</p>

<p>You can look back and read what was said of him: &ldquo;A thin, delicate-faced
man, with a rather sad expression and mild brown eyes.&rdquo; The
sad expression was <em>in</em> the eyes: that was certain: thoughtful, dreamy,
and would have been painfully sad but for its sweetness. But it is not
given to every one to discern this inward sadness in the look of another.</p>

<p>It was of no avail to say that Thomas Rymer had brought trouble
upon himself, and marred his own fortune. His father was a curate in
Warwickshire, poor in pence, rich in children. Thomas was apprenticed
to a doctor in Birmingham, who was also a chemist and druggist. Tom
had to serve in the shop, take out teeth, make up the physic, and go
round with his master to fevers and rheumatisms. Whilst he was
doing this, the curate died: and thenceforth Thomas would have to
make his own way in the world, with not a soul to counsel him.</p>

<p>Of course he might have made it. But Fate, or Folly, was against
him. Some would have called it fate, Mrs. Todhetley for one; others
might have said it was folly.</p>

<p>Next door to the doctor&rsquo;s was a respectable pork and sausage shop,
carried on by a widow, one Mrs. Bates. Rymer took to going in there
of an evening when he had the time, and sitting in the parlour behind
with Mrs. Bates and her two daughters. Failing money for theatres
and concerts, knowing no friends to drop in to, young fellows drift anywhere
for relaxation when work is done. Mrs. Bates, a good old
motherly soul, as fat as her best pig, bade him run in whenever he
felt inclined. Rymer liked her for her hearty kindness, and liked uncommonly
the dish of hot sausages, or chops, that would come on the
table for supper. The worst was, he grew to like something else&mdash;and
that was Miss Susannah.</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s true that people are attracted by their contrasts, there might
have been some excuse for Rymer. He was quiet and sensitive, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
a refined mind and person, and retiring manners. Susannah Bates was
free, loud, good-humoured, and vulgar. Some people, it was said,
called her handsome then; but, judging by what she was later, we
thought it must have been a very broad style of beauty. The Miss
Bateses were intended by their mother to be useful; but they preferred
being stylish. They played &ldquo;Buy a broom&rdquo; and other fashionable
tunes on the piano, spent time over their abundant hair, wore silks for
best, carried a fan to chapel on Sundays, and could not be persuaded
to serve in the shop on the busiest day. Good Mrs. Bates managed
the shop herself with the help of her foreman: a steady young man,
whose lodgings were up a court hard by.</p>

<p>Well, Tom Rymer, the poor clergyman&rsquo;s son, grew to be as intimate
there as if it were his home, and he and Susannah struck up a friendship
that continued all the years he was at the next door. Just before he
was out of his time, Mrs. Bates died.</p>

<p>The young foreman somehow contrived to secure the business for
himself, and married the elder Miss Bates off-hand. There ensued some
frightful squabbling between the sisters. The portion of money said to
be due to Miss Susannah was handed over to her with a request that
she should find herself another home. Rymer came of age just then,
and the first thing he did was to give her a home himself by making her
his wife.</p>

<p>There was the blight. His prospects were over from that day. The
little money she had was soon spent: he must provide a living how
he could. Instead of qualifying himself for a surgeon, he took a situation
as a chemist and druggist&rsquo;s assistant: and, later, set up for himself
in the shop at Timberdale. For the first ten years of his married life,
he was always intending to pass the necessary examinations: each year
saying it should be done the next. But expenses came on thick and
fast; and that great need with every one, present wants, had to be
supplied first. He gave up the hope then: went on in the old jog-trot
line, and subsided into an obscure rural chemist and druggist.</p>

<p>The son, Benjamin, was intended for a surgeon. As a preliminary,
he was bound apprentice to his father in order to learn the mysteries
of drugs and chemicals. When out of his time, he was transferred to
a chemist and druggist&rsquo;s at Tewkesbury, who was also in practice as a
medical man. There, Mr. Benjamin fell in with bad companions; a
lapse that, in course of time, resulted in his coming home, changing the
note in our letter for the stolen one, and then decamping from Timberdale.
What with the blow the discovery itself was to Rymer, and what
with the concealing of the weighty secret&mdash;for he had to conceal it: he
could not go and inform against his own son&mdash;it pretty nearly did for
him. Rymer tried to make reparation in one sense of the word&mdash;by
the bringing of that five-pound bank-note to the Squire. For which the
Squire, ignorant of the truth, thought him a downright lunatic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>For some months, after that evening, Thomas Rymer was to be seen
in his shop as usual, growing to look more and more like a ghost.
Which Darbyshire, the Timberdale doctor, said was owing to liver, and
physicked him well.</p>

<p>But the physic did not answer. Of all obstinate livers, as Darbyshire
said, Rymer&rsquo;s was about the worst he had ever had to do with. Some
days he could not go into the shop at all, and Margaret, his daughter,
had to serve the customers. She could make up prescriptions just as
well as he, and people grew to trust her. They had a good business.
It was known that Rymer&rsquo;s drugs were genuine; had direct from the
fountain-head. He had given up the post-office, and the grocer opposite
had taken to it&mdash;Salmon, who was brother to Salmon of South Crabb.
In this uncertain way, a week ill, and a week tolerably well, Rymer
continued to go on for about two years.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Margaret Rymer stood behind the counter: a neat little girl in grey
merino. Her face was just like her father&rsquo;s; the same delicate features,
the sweet brown eyes, and the look of innate refinement. Margaret
belonged to his side of the house; there was not an atom of the Brummagem
Bateses in her. The Squire, who remembered her grandfather
the clergyman, said Margaret took after him. She was in her nineteenth
year now, and for steadiness you might have trusted her alone right
across the world and back again.</p>

<p>She stood behind the counter, making up some medicine. A woman
in a coarse brown cloak with a showy cotton handkerchief tied on her
head was waiting for it. It had been a dull autumn day: evening was
coming on, and the air felt chilly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much be it, please, miss?&rdquo; asked the woman, as Margaret
handed her the bottle of mixture, done up in white paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eighteenpence. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be the master better?&rdquo; the woman turned round from the door to
inquire, as if the state of Mr. Rymer&rsquo;s health had been an afterthought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he is a little. He has a very bad cold, and is lying in bed
to-day. Thank you for asking. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When dusk came on, Margaret shut the street-door and went into
the parlour. Mrs. Rymer sat there writing a letter. Margaret just
glanced in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, can you listen to the shop, please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can if I choose&mdash;what should hinder me?&rdquo; responded Mrs.
Rymer. &ldquo;Where are you off to, Margaret?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To sit with my father for a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t bother to leave the shop for that. I dare say he&rsquo;s
asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stay long,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Call me, please, if any one
comes in.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>She escaped up the staircase, which stood in the nook between the
shop and the parlour. Thomas Rymer lay back in the easy-chair by
his bit of bedroom fire. He looked as ill as a man could look, his
face thin and sallow, the fine nose pinched, the mild brown eyes
mournful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa, I did not know you were getting up,&rdquo; said Margaret, in a
soft low tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear me, child?&rdquo; was his reply, for the room was over
the shop. &ldquo;I have been long enough about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it was my mother moving about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has not been here all the afternoon. What is she doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she is writing a letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Rymer groaned&mdash;which might have been caused by the pain
that he was always feeling. Mrs. Rymer&rsquo;s letters were few and far
between, and written to one correspondent only&mdash;her son Benjamin.
That Benjamin was random and must be getting a living in any chance
way, or not getting one at all, and that he had never been at home for
between two and three years, Margaret knew quite well. But she knew
no worse. The secret hidden between Mr. and Mrs. Rymer, that they
never spoke of to each other, had been kept from her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you had not got up,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;You are not well
enough to come down to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her, rather quickly; and spoke after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t make an effort&mdash;as Darbyshire tells me&mdash;it may end in
my becoming a confirmed invalid, child. I must get down while
I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will get better soon, papa; Mr. Darbyshire says so,&rdquo; she
answered, quietly swallowing down a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, I know he does. I hope it will be so, please God. My life
has been only a trouble throughout, Margaret; but I should like to
struggle with it yet for all your sakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking at him as he sat there, the firelight playing upon his worn
face with its subdued spirit, you might have seen it was true&mdash;that his
life had been a continuous trouble. Was he born to it? or did it only
come upon him through marrying Susannah Bates? On the surface of
things, lots seemed very unequally dealt out in this world. What had
been the lot of Thomas Rymer? The poor son of a poor curate, he
had known little but privation in his earlier years; then came the long
drudgery of his apprenticeship, then his marriage, and the longer
drudgery of his after-life. An uncongenial and unsuitable marriage&mdash;and
he had felt it to the backbone. From twenty to thirty years had
Rymer toiled in a shop late and early; never taking a day&rsquo;s rest or a
day&rsquo;s holiday, for some one must always be on duty, and he had no
help or substitute. Even on Sundays he must be at hand, lest his
neighbours should be taken ill and want drugs. If he went to church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
there was no certainty that his servant-maid&mdash;generally a stout young
woman in her teens, with a black face and rough hair&mdash;would not
astonish the congregation by flying up to his pew-door to call him out.
Indeed the vision was not so very uncommon. Where, then, could
have been Rymer&rsquo;s pleasure in life? He had none; it was all work.
And upon the work came the trouble.</p>

<p>Just as the daughter, Margaret, was like her father, so the son,
Benjamin, resembled his mother. But for the difference of years, and
that his red hair was short and hers long, he might have put on a lace
cap, and sat for her portrait. He was the eldest of the children;
Margaret the youngest, those between had died. Seven years
between children makes a difference, and Margaret with her gentleness
had always been afraid of rough Benjamin.</p>

<p>But whether a child is ugly or handsome, it&rsquo;s all the same to the
parents, and for some years the only white spot in Thomas Rymer&rsquo;s
life had been the love of his little Benjamin. For the matter of that,
as a child, Ben was rather pretty. He grew up and turned out wild;
and it was just as great a blow as could have fallen upon Rymer. But
when that horrible thing was brought home to him&mdash;taking the bank-note
out of the letter, and substituting the stolen one for it&mdash;then
Rymer&rsquo;s heart gave in. Ever since that time it had been as good as
breaking.</p>

<p>Well, that was Thomas Rymer&rsquo;s lot in life. Some people seem, on
the contrary, to have nothing but sunshine. Do you know what Mrs.
Todhetley says?&mdash;that the greater the cloud here, the brighter will be
the recompense hereafter. Looking at Thomas Rymer&rsquo;s face as the
fire played on it&mdash;its goodness of expression, almost that of a martyr;
remembering his prolonged battle with the world&rsquo;s cares, and his
aching heart; knowing how inoffensive he had been towards his
fellow-creatures, ever doing them a good turn when it lay in his power,
and never an ill one&mdash;one could only hope that his recompense would
be of the largest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had many people in this afternoon, Margaret?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty well, papa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Rymer sighed. &ldquo;When I get stronger&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Margaret! Shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The loud coarse summons was Mrs. Rymer&rsquo;s. Margaret&rsquo;s spirit
recoiled from it the least in the world. In spite of her having been
brought up to the &ldquo;shop,&rdquo; there had always been something in her
innate refinement that rebelled against it and against having to serve
in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A haperth o&rsquo; liquorish&rdquo; was the extensive order from a small child,
whose head did not come much above the counter. Margaret served
it at once: the liquorice, being often in demand, was kept done up in
readiness. The child laid down the halfpenny and went out with a bang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I may as well run over with the letter,&rdquo; thought Margaret&mdash;alluding
to an order she had written to London for some drug they were out of.
&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s my mother&rsquo;s. Mother,&rdquo; she added, going to the parlour-door,
&ldquo;do you want your letter posted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll post it myself when I do,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Rymer. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it
almost time you had the gas lighted? That shop must be in darkness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was so, nearly. But the gas was never lighted until really
needed, in the interests of economy. Margaret ran across the road,
put her letter into the post in Salmon&rsquo;s window, and ran back again.
She stood for a moment at the door, looking at a huge lumbering
caravan that was passing&mdash;a ménage on wheels, as seen by the light
within its small windows. &ldquo;It must be on its way to Worcester fair,&rdquo;
she thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it you, Margaret? How d&rsquo;ye do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some great rough man had come up, and was attempting to kiss
her. Margaret started back with a cry. She would have closed the
door against him; but he was the stronger and got in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what possesses the child! Don&rsquo;t you know me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every pulse in Margaret Rymer&rsquo;s body tingled to pain as she
recognized him. It was her brother Benjamin. Better, than this, that
it had been what she fancied&mdash;some rude stranger, who in another
moment would have passed on and been gone for ever. Benjamin&rsquo;s
coming was always the signal for discomfort at home, and Margaret
felt half-paralyzed with dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are the old folk, Maggie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa is very ill,&rdquo; she answered, her voice slightly trembling.
&ldquo;My mother is well as usual. I think she was writing to you this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Governor ill! So I&rsquo;ve heard. Upstairs a good deal, is he not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite half his time, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who attends here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You!&mdash;you little mite! Brought your knowledge of rhubarb to
good use, eh? What&rsquo;s the matter with papa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has not been well for a long while. I don&rsquo;t know what it is.
Mr. Darbyshire says&rdquo;&mdash;she dropped her voice a little&mdash;&ldquo;that he is
sure there&rsquo;s something on his mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old dad!&mdash;just like him! If a woman came in with a broken
arm, he&rsquo;d take it to heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Benjamin, I think it is <em>you</em> that he has most at heart,&rdquo; the girl
took courage to say.</p>

<p>Mr. Benjamin laughed. &ldquo;Me! He needn&rsquo;t trouble about me. I
am as steady as old Time, Maggie. I&rsquo;ve come home to stay; and I&rsquo;ll
prove to him that I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come home to stay!&rdquo; faltered Margaret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I can take care of things here. I am better able to do it than
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father will not put me out of my place here,&rdquo; said Margaret,
steadily. &ldquo;He has confidence in me; he knows I do things just as he
does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for that reason he makes you his substitute! Don&rsquo;t assume,
Miss Maggie; you&rsquo;d be more in your place stitching wristbands in the
parlour than as the presiding genius in a drug-shop. How d&rsquo;ye do,
mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sound of his voice had reached Mrs. Rymer. She did not
believe her own ears, and came stealing forth to look, afraid of what
she might see. To give Madam Rymer her due, she was quite as
honest-natured as her husband; and the matter of the bank-note, the
wrong use made of the keys she was foolish enough to lend surreptitiously
to Mr. Benjamin, had brought her no light shock at the time.
Ill-conduct in the shape of billiards, and beer, and idleness, she had
found plenty of excuse for in her son; but when it came to felony, it
was another thing altogether.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>is</em> him!&rdquo; she muttered, as he saw her, and turned. &ldquo;Where
on earth have you sprung from?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Rymer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not from the skies, mother. Hearing the governor was on the
sick list, I thought I ought to come over and see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of your lies, Ben,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rymer. &ldquo;<em>That</em> has not brought
you here. You are in some disgraceful mess again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>has</em> brought me here&mdash;and nothing else,&rdquo; said Ben: and he
spoke truth. &ldquo;Ashton of Timberdale&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A faint groan&mdash;a crash as of breaking glass. When they turned to
look, there was Rymer, fallen against the counter in his shock of
surprise and weakness. His arm had thrown down an empty syrup-bottle.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s how Benjamin Rymer came home. His father and
mother had never seen him since before the discovery of the trouble;
for as soon as he had changed the bank-note in the letter, he was off.
The affair had frightened him a little&mdash;that is, the stir made over it, of
which he had contrived to get notice; since then he had been passably
steady, making a living for himself in Birmingham as assistant to a
surgeon and druggist. He had met Robert Ashton a short time ago
(this was the account he now gave), heard from that gentleman rather
a bad account of his father, and so thought it his duty to give up what
he was about, and come home. His duty! Ben Rymer&rsquo;s duty!!</p>

<p>Ben was a tall, bony fellow, with a passably liberal education. He
might not have been unsteady but for bad companions. Ben did not
aid in robbing the butcher&rsquo;s till&mdash;he had not quite come to that&mdash;neither
was he privy to it; but he did get persuaded into trying to
dispose of one of the stolen notes. It had been the one desperate act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of his life, and it had sobered him. Time, however, effaces impressions;
from two to three years had gone on since then; nothing had
transpired, never so much as a suspicion had fallen on Mr. Benjamin,
and he grew bold and came home.</p>

<p>Timberdale rubbed its eyes with astonishment that next autumn
day, when it woke up to see Benjamin Rymer in his father&rsquo;s shop, a
white apron on, and serving the customers who went in, as naturally
as though he had never left it. Where had he been all that while?
they asked. Improving himself in his profession, coolly avowed Ben
with unruffled face.</p>

<p>And so the one chance&mdash;rest of mind&mdash;for the father&rsquo;s return to
health and life, went out. The prolonged time, passing without
discovery, giving a greater chance day by day that it might never
happen, could but have a beneficial effect on Mr. Rymer. But when
Ben made his appearance, put his head, so to say, into the very
stronghold of danger, all his sickness and his fear came back again.</p>

<p>Ben did not know why his father kept so poorly and looked so ill.
Never a word, in his sensitiveness, had Mr. Rymer spoken to his son
of that past night&rsquo;s work. Ben might suspect, but he did not know.
Mr. Rymer would come down when he was not fit to do so, and take
up his place in the shop on a stool. Ben made fun of it: in sport
more than ill-feeling: telling the customers to look at the old ghost
there. Ben made himself perfectly at home; would sometimes hold a
levée in the shop if his father was out of it, when he and his friends,
young men of Timberdale, would talk and laugh the roof off.</p>

<p>People talk of the troubles of the world, and say their name is
legion: poverty, sickness, disappointment, disgrace, debt, difficulty;
but there is no trouble the human heart can know like that brought by
rebellious children. To old Rymer, with his capacity for taking things
to heart, it had been as a long crucifixion. And yet&mdash;the instinctive
love of a parent cannot die out: recollect David&rsquo;s grief for wicked
Absalom: &ldquo;Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my
son!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still, compared with what he used to be, Ben Rymer was steady.
As the winter approached, there set in another phase of the reformation;
for he pulled up even from the talking and laughing, and became
as good as gold. You might have thought he had taken his dead
grandfather, the clergyman, for a model, and was striving to walk in
his steps. He went to church, read his medical works, was pleasant
at home, gentle with Margaret, and altogether the best son in the
world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it last, Benjamin?&rdquo; his father asked him sorrowfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shall last, father; I promise it,&rdquo; was the earnestly-spoken
answer. &ldquo;Forget the past, and I will never, I hope, try you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben kept his promise throughout the winter, and seemed likely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
keep it always. Mr. Rymer grew stronger, and was in business
regularly, which gave Ben more leisure for his books. It was thought
that a good time had set in for the Rymers; but, as Mrs. Todhetley
says, you cannot control Fate.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>One day, when we were again staying at Crabb Cot, I had to call at
the shop for a box of &ldquo;Household Pills,&rdquo; Rymer&rsquo;s own making. When
any one was ailing at home, Mrs. Todhetley would administer a dose
of these pills. But that Rymer was so conscientious a man, I should
have thought they were composed of bread and pepper. Mrs.
Todhetley pinned her faith to them, and said they did wonders.</p>

<p>Well, I had to go to Timberdale on other matters, and was told to
call, when there, for a box of these delectable Household Pills. Mr.
Rymer and his son stood behind the counter, the one making up his
books, Ben pounding something in a mortar. Winter was just on the
turn, and the trees and hedges were beginning to shoot into bud. Ben
left his pounding to get the pills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this Mr. Rymer&rsquo;s? Halloa, Ben! All right. How goes it,
old boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door had been opened with a burst, and the above words met
our ears, in a tone not over-steady. They came from a man who wore
sporting clothes, and his hat very much on one side. Ben Rymer
stared in surprise; his mouth dropped.</p>

<p>But that it was early in the day, and one does not like to libel
people, it might have been thought the gentleman had taken a little
too much of something strong. He swaggered up to the counter, and
held out his hand to Ben. Ben, just then wrapping up the box of
pills, did not appear to see it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had a hunt after you, old fellow,&rdquo; said the loud-voiced stranger.
&ldquo;Been to Birmingham and all kinds of places. Couldn&rsquo;t think where
you&rsquo;d hid yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are back pretty soon,&rdquo; growled Ben, who certainly did not
seem to relish the visit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Been back a month. Couldn&rsquo;t get on in the New World; its folks
are too down for me. I say, I want a word with you. Can&rsquo;t say it
here, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Ben, rather savagely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just come out a bit, Ben,&rdquo; resumed the stranger, after a short
pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Ben&mdash;and his tone sounded more like I won&rsquo;t.
&ldquo;I have my business to attend to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bother business! Here goes, then: it&rsquo;s your fault if you make me
speak before people. Gibbs has come out of hiding, and is getting
troublesome&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will go outside and wait, I&rsquo;ll come to you,&rdquo; interrupted Ben
at this, very quickly.</p>

<p>The man turned and swaggered out. Ben gave me the pills with one
hand, and took off his apron with the other. Getting his hat, he was
hastening out, when Mr. Rymer touched his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is that man, Benjamin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fellow I used to know in Tewkesbury, father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cotton. I&rsquo;ll soon despatch him and be back again,&rdquo; concluded
Ben, as he disappeared.</p>

<p>I put down half-a-crown for the pills, and Mr. Rymer left his place
to give me the change. There had been a sort of consciousness
between us, understood though not expressed, since the night when I
had seen him giving way to his emotion in Crabb Ravine. This man&rsquo;s
visit brought the scene back again. Rymer&rsquo;s eyes looked into mine,
and then fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben is all right now, Mr. Rymer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not wish him better than he is. It&rsquo;s just as though he
were striving to atone for the past. I thought it would have killed me
at the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should forget it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget it I never can. You don&rsquo;t know what it was, Mr. Johnny,&rdquo;
he continued in a sort of frightened tone, a red spot coming into his
pale thin cheeks, &ldquo;and I trust you never will know. I never went to
bed at night but to lie listening for a summons at my door&mdash;the officers
searching for my son, or to tell me he was taken. I never rose in the
morning but my spirit fainted within me, as to what news the day
might bring forth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Benjamin and his friend were pacing side by side in the middle
of the street when I went out, probably to be out of the reach of
eavesdroppers. They did not look best pleased with each other;
seemed to be talking sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you I can&rsquo;t and I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Ben was saying, as I passed them
in crossing over. &ldquo;What do you come after me for? When a fellow
wants to be on the square, you won&rsquo;t let him. As to Gibbs&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voices died out of hearing. I went home with the pills, and
thought no more about the matter.</p>

<p>Spring weather is changeable, as we English know only too well. In
less than a week, a storm of sleet and snow was drifting down. In the
midst of it, who should present himself at Crabb Cot at midday but
Lee, the letter-carrier. His shaky old legs seemed hardly able to bear
him up against the storm, as he came into the garden. I opened the
door, wondering what he wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please can I see the Squire in private, sir?&rdquo; asked Lee, who was
looking half angry, half rueful. Lee had never been in boisterous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
spirits since the affair of the bank-note took place. Like a great many
more people, he grew fanciful with years, and could not be convinced
but that the suspicion in regard to it lay on <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in out of the storm, Lee. What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Mr. Ludlow, sir, let me get to see the Squire,&rdquo; was all his
answer.</p>

<p>The Squire was in his little room, hunting for a mislaid letter in the
piece of furniture he called his bureau. As I shut old Lee in, I heard
him, Lee, begin to say something about the bank-note and Benjamin
Rymer. An instinct of the truth flashed over me&mdash;as sure as fate
something connecting Ben with it had come out. In I shot again, to
make one at the conference. The Squire was looking too surprised to
notice me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Mr. Rymer&rsquo;s son who took out the good note and put in the
bad one?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Take care what you say, Lee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lee stood near the worn hearthrug; his old hat, covered with
snow-flakes, held between his hands. The Squire had put his back
against the bureau and was staring at him through his spectacles, his
nose and face a finer red than ordinary.</p>

<p>The thing had been tracked home to Benjamin Rymer by the man
Cotton, Lee explained in a rambling sort of tale. Cotton, incensed at
Rymer&rsquo;s not helping him to some money&mdash;which was what he had
come to Timberdale to ask for&mdash;had told in revenge of the past
transaction. Cotton had not been connected with it, but knew of the
part taken in it by Rymer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a syllable of it,&rdquo; said the Squire, stoutly, flinging
himself into his bureau chair, which he twisted round to face the fire.
&ldquo;You can sit down, Lee. Where did you say you heard this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lee had heard it at the Plough and Harrow, where the man Cotton
had been staying. Jelf, the landlord, had been told it by Cotton
himself, and Jelf in his turn had whispered it to Lee. That was last
night: and Lee had come up with it now to Mr. Todhetley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Lee, I don&rsquo;t believe a syllable of it,&rdquo; repeated the
Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It be true as gospel, sir,&rdquo; asserted Lee. &ldquo;Last night, when I went
in to Jelf&rsquo;s for a drop of beer, being stiff all over with the cold, I found
Jelf in a passion because a guest had gone off without paying part of
his score, leaving nothing but a letter to say he&rsquo;d send it. Cotton by
name, Jelf explained, and a sporting gent to look at. A good week,
Jelf vowed he&rsquo;d been there, living on the best. And then Jelf said I
had no cause to be looked down upon any longer, for it was not me
that had done that trick with the bank-notes, but Benjamin Rymer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now just stop, Lee,&rdquo; interrupted the Squire. &ldquo;Nobody looked
down upon you for it, or suspected you: neither Jelf nor other people.
I have told you so times enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But Jelf knows I thought they did, sir. And he told me this news
to put me a bit at my ease. He&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jelf talks at random when his temper&rsquo;s up,&rdquo; cried the Squire.
&ldquo;If you believe this story, Lee, you&rsquo;ll believe anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ben Rymer was staying at home at the time, sir,&rdquo; urged Lee,
determined to have his say. &ldquo;If he is steady now, it&rsquo;s known what he
was then. He must have got access to the letters somehow, while
they lay at his father&rsquo;s that night, and opened yours and changed the
note. Cotton says Mr. Ben had had the stolen note hid about him for
ever so long, waiting an opportunity to get rid of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to accuse Mr. Ben of being one of the thieves who
robbed the butcher&rsquo;s till?&rdquo; demanded the Squire, growing wrathful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I don&rsquo;t go as far as that. The man told Jelf that one of
the stolen notes was given to young Rymer to pass, and he was to have
a pound for himself if he succeeded in doing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire would hardly let him finish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cotton said this to Jelf, did he?&mdash;and Jelf rehearsed it to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Just that much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now look you here, Lee. First of all, to whom have you repeated
this tale?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to anybody,&rdquo; answered Lee. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d better bring it
up here, sir, to begin with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d better let it stop here to end with,&rdquo; retorted the Squire.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my best advice to you, Lee. My goodness! Accuse a
respectable man&rsquo;s son of what might transport him, on the authority of
a drunken fellow who runs away from an inn without paying his bill!
The likeliest thing is that this Cotton did it himself. How else should
he know about it? Don&rsquo;t you let your tongue carry this further, Lee,
or you may find yourself in the wrong box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lee looked just a little staggered. A faint flush appeared in his
withered face. The Squire&rsquo;s colour was at its fiercest. He was hard
at the best of times to take in extraordinary tales, and utterly scouted
this one. There was no man he had a greater respect for than Thomas
Rymer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hoped you might be for prosecuting, sir. It would set me right
with the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a fool, Lee. The world has not thought you wrong yet.
Prosecute! I! Upon this cock-and-bull story! Mr. Rymer would
prosecute me in turn, I expect, if I did. You&rsquo;d better not let this get
to his ears: you might lose your post.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rymer, sir, must know how wild his son has been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wild! Most of the young men of the present day are that, as it
seems to me,&rdquo; cried the Squire, in his heat. &ldquo;Mine had better not let
me catch <em>them</em> at it, though. I&rsquo;d warm their ears well beforehand if I
thought they ever would&mdash;&mdash; Do you hear, Mr. Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>I had been leaning on the back of a chair in the quietest corner for
fear of being sent away. When the Squire put himself up like this, he
would say anything.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be a bit wild is one thing, Lee; to commit felony quite another:
Rymer&rsquo;s son would be no more guilty of it than you would. It&rsquo;s out of
all reason. And do you take care of your tongue. Look here, man:
suppose I took this up, as you want me, and it was found to have been
Cotton or some other gaol-bird who did it, instead of young Rymer:
where would you be? In prison for defamation of character, if the
Rymers chose to put you there. Be wise in time, Lee, and say no
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might have been as you say, sir&mdash;Cotton himself; though I&rsquo;m
sure that never struck me,&rdquo; returned Lee, veering round to the argument.
&ldquo;One thing that made me believe it, was knowing that Ben
Rymer might easily get access to the letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s just the reason why you should have doubted it,&rdquo; contradicted
the Squire. &ldquo;He would be afraid to touch them because of
the ease with which he could do it. Forgive you for coming up, you
say?&rdquo; added the Squire, as Lee rose with some humble words of excuse.
&ldquo;Of course I will. But don&rsquo;t forget that a word of this, dropped abroad,
might put your place, as postman, in jeopardy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that would never do,&rdquo; said Lee, shaking his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> should think not. It&rsquo;s cold to-day, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frightful cold, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you could come through it with this improbable story! Use
your sense another time, Lee. Here, Johnny, take Lee into the kitchen,
and tell them to give him some cold beef and beer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I handed him over, with the order, to Molly; who went into one of
her tantrums at it, for she was in the midst of pastry-making. The
Squire was sitting with his head bent, looking as perplexed as an owl,
when I got back to the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny&mdash;shut the door. Something has come into my mind. Do
you recollect Thomas Rymer&rsquo;s coming up one evening, and wanting to
give me a five-pound note?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite well, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well; I&mdash;I am not so sure now that there&rsquo;s nothing in this fresh
tale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sat down; and in a low voice told him all. Of the fit of sobbing
in which I had found Rymer that same night in the Ravine; and that
I had known all along it <em>was</em> the son who had done it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless my heart!&rdquo; cried the Squire, softly, very much taken aback.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that, perhaps, that has been making Rymer so ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said it was slowly killing him, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercy on him!&mdash;poor fellow! An ill-doing scapegrace of a rascal!
Johnny, how thankful we ought to be when our sons turn out well, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
not ill! But I think a good many turn out ill nowadays. If you
should live to have sons, sir, take care how you bring them up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Mr. Rymer must have tried to bring Ben up well,&rdquo; was my
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; but did the mother?&rdquo; retorted the Squire. &ldquo;More responsibility
lies with them than with the father, Johnny; and she spoilt
him. Take care, sir, how you choose a wife when the time comes.
And there was that miserable lot the lad fell in with at Tewkesbury!
Johnny, that Cotton must be an awful blackguard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;ll live to feel it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, we must hush this up,&rdquo; cried the Squire, sinking his
voice and glancing round the room. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t bring fresh pain on
poor Rymer for the world. You must forget that you&rsquo;ve told me, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a five-pound note, after all. And if it were fifty pounds,
I wouldn&rsquo;t stir in it. No, nor for five hundred; be hanged if I would!
It&rsquo;s not I that would bring the world about Thomas Rymer&rsquo;s ears. I
knew his father and respected him, Johnny; though his sermons were
three-quarters of an hour long, sometimes; and I respect Thomas
Rymer. You and I must keep this close. And I&rsquo;ll make a journey to
Timberdale when this snow-storm&rsquo;s gone, Johnny, and frighten Jelf
out of his life for propagating libellous tales.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where it ought to have ended. The worst is, &ldquo;oughts&rdquo; don&rsquo;t
go for much in the world; as perhaps every reader of this paper has
learned to know.</p>

<p>When Lee appeared the next morning with the letters as usual, I
went out to him. He dropped his voice to speak, as he put them in
my hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say Benjamin Rymer is off, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Off where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somewhere out of Timberdale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Off for what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. Jelf accused me of having carried tales there,
and called me a jackass for my pains. He said that what he had told
me wasn&rsquo;t meant to be repeated again, and I ought not to have gone
telling it about, especially to the Rymers themselves; that it might not
be true&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the Squire said yesterday, you know, Lee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I answered Jelf that it couldn&rsquo;t have been me that had
gone talking to the Rymers, for I had not as much as seen them. Any
way, he said, somebody had, for they knew of it, and Benjamin had
gone off in consequence. Jelf&rsquo;s as cross over it as two sticks. It&rsquo;s his
own fault; why did he tell me what wasn&rsquo;t true?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lee went off&mdash;looking cross also. After breakfast I related this to
the Squire. He didn&rsquo;t seem to like it, and walked about thinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny, I can&rsquo;t stir in it, you see,&rdquo; he said presently. &ldquo;If it got
abroad, people might talk about compromising a felony, and all that
sort of rubbish: and I am a magistrate. You must go. See Rymer:
and make him understand&mdash;without telling him in so many words, you
know&mdash;that there&rsquo;s nothing to fear from me, and he may call Ben back
again. If the young man has begun to lead a new life, Heaven forbid
that I, having sons myself, should be a stumbling-block in the way
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was striking twelve when I reached Timberdale. Margaret said
her father was poorly, having gone out in the storm of the previous
day and caught a chill. He was in the parlour alone, cowering over
the fire. In the last few hours he seemed to have aged years. I shut
the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;I have come on purpose to
ask you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That which I have been dreading all along,&rdquo; he said in a quiet,
hopeless tone. &ldquo;Benjamin has run away. He got some information,
it seems, from the landlord of the Plough and Harrow, and was off the
next hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, the Squire sent me to you privately, Mr. Rymer, to say
that Ben might come back again. He has nothing to fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Squire knows it, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Lee came up about it yesterday: Jelf had talked to him.
Mr. Todhetley did not believe a word of it: he blew up Lee like
anything for listening to such a tale; he means to blow up Jelf
for repeating anything said by a vagabond like Cotton. Lee came
round to his way of thinking. Indeed there&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of.
Jelf is eating his words. The Squire would not harm your son for the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rymer shook his head. He did not doubt the Squire&rsquo;s friendly feeling,
but thought it was out of his hands. He told me all he knew
about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Benjamin came to me yesterday morning in a great flurry, saying
something was wrong, and he must absent himself. Was it about the
bank-note, I asked&mdash;and it was the first time a syllable in regard to it
had passed between us,&rdquo; broke off Rymer. &ldquo;Jelf had given him a
friendly hint of what had dropped from the man Cotton&mdash;you were in
the shop that first day when he came in, Mr. Johnny&mdash;and Benjamin
was alarmed. Before I had time to collect my thoughts, or say further,
he was gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I went round at once to Jelf, and the man told me
all. Jelf knows the truth; that is quite clear. He says he has spoken
only to Lee; is sorry now for having done that, and he will hush it up
as far as he can.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it will be quite right, Mr. Rymer. Why should you be
taking it in this way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am ill,&rdquo; was all he answered. &ldquo;I caught a chill going round to
the Plough and Harrow. So far as mental illness goes, we may battle
with it to the end, strength from above being given to us; but when it
takes bodily form&mdash;why, there&rsquo;s nothing for it but giving in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even while we spoke, he was seized with what seemed to be an
ague. Mrs. Rymer appeared with some scalding broth, and I said I
would run for Darbyshire.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few days went on, and then news came up to Crabb Cot that Mr.
Rymer lay dying. Robert Ashton, riding back from the hunt in his
scarlet coat and white cords on his fine grey horse (the whole a mass
of splashes with the thaw) pulled up at the door to say How d&rsquo;ye do?
and mentioned it amidst other items. It was just a shock to the
Squire, and nothing less.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness preserve us!&mdash;and all through that miserable five-pound
note, Johnny!&rdquo; he cried in a wild flurry. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my hat and
top-coat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Away to Timberdale by the short cut through the Ravine, never
heeding the ghost&mdash;although its traditional time of appearing, the dusk
of evening, was drawing on&mdash;went the Squire. He thought Rymer
must be ill through fear of him; and he accused me of having done
my errand of peace badly.</p>

<p>It was quite true&mdash;Thomas Rymer lay dying. Darbyshire was
coming out of the house as the Squire reached it, and said so. Instead
of being sorry, he flew in a passion and attacked the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now look you here, Darbyshire&mdash;this won&rsquo;t do. We can&rsquo;t have
people dying off like this for nothing. If you don&rsquo;t cure him, you had
better give up doctoring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;you mean for nothing?&rdquo; asked Darbyshire, who knew the
Squire well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be for much: don&rsquo;t be insolent. Because a man gets a
bit of anxiety on his mind, is he to be let die?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard nothing about anxiety,&rdquo; said Darbyshire. &ldquo;He caught
a chill through going out that day of the snow-storm, and it settled on
a vital part. That&rsquo;s what ails him, Squire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you can&rsquo;t cure the chill! Don&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before this time to-morrow, Thomas Rymer will be where there&rsquo;s
neither killing nor curing,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I told them yesterday
to send for the son: but they don&rsquo;t know where he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire made a rush through the shop and up to the bedroom,
hardly saying, &ldquo;With your leave,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;By your leave.&rdquo; Thomas Rymer
lay in bed at the far end; his white face whiter than the pillow; his
eyes sunken; his hands plucking at the counterpane. Margaret left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
room when the Squire went in. He gave one look; and knew that he
saw death there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rymer, I&rsquo;d almost have given my own life to save you from this,&rdquo;
cried he, in the shock. &ldquo;Oh, my goodness! what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seem to have been waiting for it all along; to have seen the
exposure coming,&rdquo; said Thomas Rymer, his faint fingers resting in the
Squire&rsquo;s strong ones. &ldquo;And now that it&rsquo;s here, I can&rsquo;t battle with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Rymer, my poor fellow, couldn&rsquo;t you&mdash;<em>couldn&rsquo;t</em> you make a
bit of an effort to live? To please me: I knew your father, mind. It
can&rsquo;t be right that you should die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be right; perhaps it is well. I can truly say with old
Jacob that few and evil have the days of my life been. Nothing but
disappointment has been my lot here; struggle upon struggle, pain
upon pain, sorrow upon sorrow. I think my merciful Father will
remember it in the last great account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He died at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Lee told us of it when he
brought up the letters at breakfast-time. The Squire let fall his knife
and fork.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame and a sin, though, Johnny, that sons should inflict this
cruel sorrow upon their parents,&rdquo; he said later. &ldquo;Rymer has been
brought down to the grave by his son before his hair was grey. I
wonder how <em>their</em> accounts will stand at the great reckoning?&rdquo;</p>

HESTER REED&rsquo;S PILLS.</h2>


<p>We were at our other and chief home, Dyke Manor: and Tod and I
were there for the short Easter holidays, which were shorter in those
days than they are in these.</p>

<p>It was Easter Tuesday. The Squire had gone riding over to old
Jacobson&rsquo;s with Tod. I, having nothing else to do, got the mater to
come with me for a practice on the church organ; and we were taking
the round home again through the village, Church Dykely.</p>

<p>Easter was very late that year. It was getting towards the end of
April: and to judge by the weather, it might have been the end of
May, the days were so warm and glorious.</p>

<p>In passing the gate of George Reed&rsquo;s cottage, Mrs. Todhetley
stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are the babies, Hester?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hester Reed, sunning her white cap and clean cotton gown in the
garden, the three elder children around, watering the beds with a doll&rsquo;s
watering-pot, and a baby hiding its face on her shoulder, dropped a
curtsy as she answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They be but poorly, ma&rsquo;am, thank you. Look up, Susy,&rdquo; turning
the baby&rsquo;s face upwards to show it: and a pale mite of a face it was,
with sleepy eyes. &ldquo;For a day or two past they&rsquo;ve not seemed the
thing; and they be both cross.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think their teeth are troubling them, Hester.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe, ma&rsquo;am. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. Hetty, she seems worse
than Susy. She&rsquo;s a-lying there in the basket indoors. Would you
please spare a minute to step in and look at her, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Todhetley opened the gate. &ldquo;I may as well go in and see,
Johnny,&rdquo; she said to me in an undertone: &ldquo;I fear both the children
are rather sickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other baby, &ldquo;Hetty,&rdquo; lay in the kitchen in a clothes-basket.
It had just the same sort of puny white face as its sister. These two
were twins, and about a year old. When they were born, Church
Dykely went on finely at Hester Reed, asking her if she would not
have had enough with one new child but she must go and set up two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does seem very poorly,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Todhetley, stooping over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the young mortal (which was not cross just now, but very still and
quiet), and letting it clasp its little fist round one of her fingers. &ldquo;No
doubt it is the teeth. If the children do not get better soon, I think,
were I you, Hester, I should speak to Mr. Duffham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The advice seemed to strike Hester Reed all of a heap. &ldquo;Speak to
Dr. Duffham!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, ma&rsquo;am, they must both be a
good deal worse than they be, afore we does that. I&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;em a dose
o&rsquo; mild physic apiece. I dare say that&rsquo;ll bring &rsquo;em round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think it would not hurt them,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Todhetley.
&ldquo;They both seem feverish; this one especially. I hear you have had
Cathy over,&rdquo; she went on, passing to another subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure enough us have,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reed. &ldquo;She come over yesterday
was a week and stayed till Friday night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is she doing now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am, Cathy&rsquo;s keeping herself; and that&rsquo;s something.
She has got a place at Tewkesbury to serve in some shop; is quite in
clover there, by all accounts. Two good gownds she brought over to
her back; and she&rsquo;s pretty nigh as lighthearted as she was afore she
went off to enter on her first troubles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hannah told me she was not looking well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She have had a nasty attack of&mdash;what was it?&mdash;neuralgy, I think
she called it, and been obliged to go to a doctor,&rdquo; answered Hester
Reed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why they gave her the holiday. She was very well
while she was here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had stood at the door, talking to the little ones with their watering-pot.
As the mater was taking her final word with Mrs. Reed, I went
on to open the gate for her, when some woman whisked round the
corner from Piefinch Lane, and in at the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank ye, sir,&rdquo; said she to me: as if I had been holding it open for
her especial benefit.</p>

<p>It was Ann Dovey, the blacksmith&rsquo;s wife down Piefinch Cut: a
smart young woman, fond of fine gowns and caps. Mrs. Todhetley
came away, and Ann Dovey went in. And this is what passed at
Reed&rsquo;s&mdash;as it leaked out to the world afterwards.</p>

<p>The baby in the basket began to cry, and Ann Dovey lifted it out
and took it on her lap. She understood all about children, having been
the eldest of a numerous flock at home, and was no doubt all the fonder
of them because she had none of her own. Mrs. Dovey was moreover
a great gossip, liking to have as many fingers in her neighbours&rsquo; pies as
she could conveniently get in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now what&rsquo;s amiss with these two twins?&rdquo; asked she in confidential
tones, bending her face forward till it nearly touched Mrs.
Reed&rsquo;s, who had sat down opposite to her with the other baby.
&ldquo;Sarah Tanken, passing our shop just now, telled me they warn&rsquo;t the
thing at all, so I thought I&rsquo;d run round.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sarah Tanken looked in while I was a-washing up after dinner,
and saw &rsquo;em both,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Reed. &ldquo;Hetty&rsquo;s the worst of the
two; more peeky like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which <em>is</em> Hetty?&rdquo; demanded Ann Dovey; who, with all her
neighbourly visits, had not learnt to distinguish the two apart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one that you be a-nursing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the mistress of the Manor look at &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; and she thinks I&rsquo;d better give &rsquo;em both some mild physic.
Leastways, I said a dose might bring &rsquo;em round,&rdquo; added Hester Reed,
correcting herself, &ldquo;and she said it might.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the very thing for &rsquo;em, Hester Reed,&rdquo; pronounced Mrs. Dovey,
decisively. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like a dose of physic for little ones; it
often stops a bout of illness. You give it to the two; and don&rsquo;t lose
no time. Grey powder&rsquo;s best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not got any grey powder by me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Reed. &ldquo;It
crossed my mind to try &rsquo;em with one o&rsquo; them pills I had from Abel
Crew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What pills be they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had &rsquo;em from him for myself the beginning o&rsquo; the year, when I
was getting the headache so much. They&rsquo;re as mild as mild can be;
but they did me good. The box is upstairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know they&rsquo;d be the right pills to give to babies?&rdquo;
sensibly questioned Mrs. Dovey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they be right enough for that! When little Georgy was poorly
two or three weeks back, I ran out to Abel Crew, chancing to see him
go by the gate, and asked whether one of his pills would do the child
harm. He said no, it would do him good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did it get him round?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never gave it. Georgy seemed to be so much pearter afore
night came, that I thought I&rsquo;d wait till the morrow. He&rsquo;s a rare bad
one to take physic, he is. You may cover a powder in treacle that
thick, Ann Dovey, but the boy scents it out somehow, and can&rsquo;t be got
to touch it. His father always has to make him; I can&rsquo;t. He got
well that time without the pill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I should try the pills on the little twins,&rdquo; advised Ann
Dovey. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they want something o&rsquo; the sort. Look at this
one! lying like a lamb in my arms, staring up at me with its poor eyes,
and never moving. You may always know when a child&rsquo;s ill by its
quietness. Nothing ailing &rsquo;em, they worry the life out of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both of them were cross enough this morning,&rdquo; remarked Hester
Reed, &ldquo;and for that reason I know they be worse now. I&rsquo;ll try the pill
to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, whether it was that Ann Dovey had any especial love for
presiding at the ceremony of administering pills to children, or whether
she only looked in again incidentally in passing, certain it was that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the evening she was for the second time at George Reed&rsquo;s cottage.
Mrs. Reed had put the three elder ones to bed; or, as she expressed it,
&ldquo;got &rsquo;em out o&rsquo; the way;&rdquo; and was undressing the twins by firelight,
when Ann Dovey tripped into the kitchen. George Reed was at work
in the front garden, digging; though it was getting almost too dark to
see where he inserted the spade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have ye give &rsquo;em their physic yet?&rdquo; was Mrs. Dovey&rsquo;s salutation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but I&rsquo;m a-going to,&rdquo; answered Hester Reed. &ldquo;You be just
come in time to hold &rsquo;em for me, Ann Dovey, while I go upstairs for
the box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ann Dovey received the pair of babies, and sat down in the low
chair. Taking the candle, Mrs. Reed ran up to the room where the
elder children slept. The house was better furnished than cottages
generally are, and the rooms were of a fairly good size. Opposite the
bed stood a high deal press with a flat top to it, which Mrs. Reed made
a shelf of, for keeping things that must be out of the children&rsquo;s reach.
Stepping on a chair, she put her hand out for the box of pills, which
stood in its usual place near the corner, and went downstairs with it.</p>

<p>It was an ordinary pasteboard pill-box, containing a few pills&mdash;six or
seven, perhaps. Mrs. Dovey, curious in all matters, lifted the lid and
sniffed at the pills. Hester Reed was getting the moist sugar they were
to be administered in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you have these here pills for?&rdquo; questioned Ann Dovey,
as Mrs. Reed came back with the sugar. &ldquo;They bain&rsquo;t over big.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For headache and pain in the side. I asked old Abel Crew if he
could give me something for it, and he gave me these pills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Reed was moistening a teaspoonful of the sugar, as she spoke,
with warm water. Taking out one of the pills she proceeded to crush
it into small bits, and then mixed it with the sugar. It formed a sort
of paste. Dose the first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t moist enough, Hester Reed,&rdquo; pronounced Mrs. Dovey,
critically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No? I&rsquo;ll put a drop more warm water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The water was added, and one of the children was fed with the
delectable compound&mdash;Hetty. Mrs. Dovey spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it all for her? Won&rsquo;t a whole pill be too much for one, d&rsquo;ye
think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit. When I asked old Abel whether one pill would be too
much for Georgy, he said, No&mdash;two wouldn&rsquo;t hurt him. I tell ye, Ann
Dovey, the pills be as mild as milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hetty took in the whole dose by degrees. Susy had a similar one
made ready, and swallowed it in her turn. Then the two babies were
conveyed upstairs and put to bed side by side in their mother&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dovey, the ceremony being over, took her departure. George
Reed came in to his early supper, and soon afterwards he and his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
went up to bed. Men who have to be up at five in the morning must
go to rest betimes. The fire and candle were put out, the doors
locked, and the cottage was steeped in quietness at a time when in
larger houses the evening was not much more than beginning.</p>

<p>How long she slept, Mrs. Reed could not tell. Whether it might be
the first part of the night, early or late, or whether morning might be
close upon the dawn, she knew not; but she was startled out of her
sleep by the cries of the babies. Awful cries, they seemed, coming
from children so young; and there could be no mistaking that each
was in terrible agony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s convulsions!&rdquo; exclaimed George Reed, when he had
lighted a candle. &ldquo;Both of them, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Going downstairs as he was, he hastily lighted the kitchen fire and
put a kettle of water on. Then, dressing himself, he ran out for Mr.
Duffham. The doctor came in soon after George Reed had got back
again.</p>

<p>Duffham was accustomed to scenes, and he entered on one now.
Mrs. Reed, in a state of distress, had put the babies in blankets
and brought them down to the kitchen fire; the three elder children,
aroused by the cries, had come down too, and were standing about in
their night-clothes, crying with fright. One of the babies was dead&mdash;Hetty.
She had just expired in her father&rsquo;s arms. The other was
dying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth have you been giving to these children?&rdquo;
exclaimed Duffham, after taking a good look at the two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, what is it, please?&rdquo; sobbed Mrs. Reed, in her terror.
&ldquo;Convulsions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Convulsions&mdash;no,&rdquo; said the doctor, in a fume. &ldquo;It is something
else, as I believe&mdash;poison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At which she set up a shriek that might have been heard out of
doors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Hetty was dead, I say;&rdquo; and Duffham could not do anything
to save the other. It died whilst he stood there. Duffham repeated
his conjecture as to poison; and Mrs. Reed, all topsy-turvy though she
was, three-parts bereft of her senses, resented the implication almost
angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poison!&rdquo; cried she. &ldquo;How can you think of such a thing, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you that to the best of my belief these children have both died
from some irritant poison,&rdquo; asserted Duffham, coolly imperative. &ldquo;I
ask what you have been giving them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have not been well this three or four days past,&rdquo; replied
she, wandering from the point; not evasively, but in her mind&rsquo;s
bewilderment. &ldquo;It must have been their teeth, sir; I thought they
were cutting &rsquo;em with fever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you give them any physic?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. A pill apiece when I put &rsquo;em to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Duffham. &ldquo;What pill was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of Abel Crew&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This answer surprised him. Allowing that his suspicion of poison
was correct, he assumed that these pills must have contained it; and
he had never had cause to suppose that Abel Crew&rsquo;s pills were otherwise
than innocent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Reed, her voice broken by sobs, explained further in answer
to his questions, telling him how she had procured these pills from
Abel Crew some time before, and had given one of the said pills to
each of the babies. Duffham stood against the dresser, taking it all in
with a solemn face, his cane held up to his chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see this box of pills, Mrs. Reed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went upstairs to get it. A tidy woman in her ways, she had
put the box in its place again on the top of the press. Duffham took
off the lid, and examined the pills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to have a bit of sealing-wax in the house, Reed?&rdquo;
he asked presently.</p>

<p>George Reed, who had stood like a man bewildered, looking first on
one, then on the other of his dead little ones, answered that he had
not. But the eldest child, Annie, spoke up, saying that there was a
piece in her little work-box; Cathy had given it her last week when
she was at home.</p>

<p>It was produced&mdash;part of a small stick of fancy wax, green and gold.
Duffham wrapped the pill-box up in the back of a letter that he took
from his pocket, and sealed it with a seal that hung to his watch-chain.
He put the parcel into the hand of George Reed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care of it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This will be wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There could not have been poison in them pills, sir,&rdquo; burst out
Mrs. Reed, her distress increasing at the possibility that he might be
right. &ldquo;If there had been, they&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; poisoned me. One night I took
three of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Duffham did not answer. He was nodding his head in answer to his
own thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who ever heard of Abel Crew mixing up poison in his pills?&rdquo;
went on Mrs. Reed. &ldquo;If you please, sir, I don&rsquo;t think he could do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that part of it puzzles me&mdash;how he came to do it,&rdquo; acknowledged
Duffham. &ldquo;I like old Abel, and shall be sorry if it is proved
that his pills have done the mischief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Reed shook her head. She had more faith than that in Abel
Crew.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ever so many years before&mdash;for it was in the time of Sir Peter
Chavasse&mdash;there appeared one day a wanderer at Church Dykely. It
was hot weather, and he seemed to think nothing of camping out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the fields by night, under the summer stars. Who he was, or what he
was, or why he had come, or why he stayed, nobody knew. He was
evidently not a tramp, or a gipsy, or a travelling tinker&mdash;quite superior
to it all; a slender, young, and silent man, with a pale and gentle face.</p>

<p>At one corner of the common, spreading itself between the village
and Chavasse Grange, there stood a covered wooden shed, formerly
used to impound stray cattle, but left to itself since the square space
for the new pound had been railed round. By-and-by it was found
that the wanderer had taken to this shed to sleep in. Next, his name
leaked out&mdash;&ldquo;Abel Crew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lived how he could, and as simply as a hermit. Buying a penny
loaf at the baker&rsquo;s, and making his dinner of it with a handful of sorrel
plucked from the fields, and a drink from the rivulet that ran through
the wilderness outside the Chavasse grounds. His days were spent in
examining roots and wild herbs, now and then in digging one up; and
his nights chiefly in studying the stars. Sir Peter struck up a sort of
speaking acquaintanceship with him, and, it was said, was surprised at
his stock of knowledge and the extent of his travels; for he knew
personally many foreign places where even Sir Peter himself had never
been. That may have caused Sir Peter&mdash;who was lord of the manor
and of the common included&mdash;to tolerate in him what it was supposed
he would not in others. Anyway, when Abel Crew began to dig the
ground about his shed, and plant roots and herbs in it, Sir Peter let
him do it and never interfered. It was quite the opposite; for Sir
Peter would sometimes stand to watch him at his work, talking the
while.</p>

<p>In the course of time there was quite an extensive garden round the
shed&mdash;comparatively speaking, you know, for we do not expect to see
a shed garden as large as that of a mansion. It was fenced in with a
hedge and wooden palings, all the work of Abel Crew&rsquo;s hands. Sir
Peter was dead then; but Lady Chavasse, guardian to the young heir,
Sir Geoffrey, extended to him the same favour that her husband had,
and, if she did not absolutely sanction what he was doing, she at any
rate did not oppose it. Abel Crew filled his garden with rare and
choice and useful field herbs, the valuable properties of which he alone
understood; and of ordinary sweet flowers, such as bees love to suck.
He set up bee-hives and sold the honey; he distilled lavender and
bergamot for perfumes; he converted his herbs and roots into
medicines, which he supplied to the poor people around, charging so
small a price for them that it could scarcely more than cover the cost
of making, and not charging at all the very poor. At the end of about
ten years from his first appearance, he took down the old shed, and
built up a more convenient cottage in its place, doing it all with his
own pair of hands. And the years went on and on, and Abel Crew
and his cottage, and his herbs, and his flowers, and his bees, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
medicines, were just as much of an institution in the parish as was the
Grange itself.</p>

<p>He and I became good friends. I liked him. You have heard how
I take likes and dislikes to faces, and I rarely saw a face that I liked
as I liked Abel Crew&rsquo;s. Not for its beauty, though it really was
beautiful, with its perfect shape and delicately carved features; but
for its unmistakable look of goodness and its innate refinement: perhaps
also for the deep, far-seeing, and often <em>sad</em> expression that sat in
the earnest eyes. He was old now&mdash;sixty, I dare say; tall, slender,
and very upright still; his white hair brushed back from his forehead
and worn rather long. What his original condition of life might have
been did not transpire; he never talked of it. More than once I had
seen him reading Latin books; and though he fell into the diction of
the country people around when talking with them, he changed his
tones and language when conversing with his betters. A character, no
doubt, he was, but a man to be respected; a man of religion, too&mdash;attending
church regularly twice on a Sunday, wet or dry, and carrying
his religion into the little things of everyday life.</p>

<p>His style of dress was old-fashioned and peculiar. So far as I saw,
it never varied. A stout coat, waistcoat, and breeches every day, all
of one colour&mdash;drab; with leathern gaiters buttoned nearly to the knee.
On Sundays he wore a suit of black silk velvet, and a frilled shirt of
fine cambric. His breeches were tied at the knee with black ribbon,
in which was a plain, glistening steel buckle; buckles to match shone
in his shoes. His stockings were black, and in the winter he wore
black-cloth gaiters. In short, on Sundays Abel Crew looked like a fine
old-fashioned English gentleman, and would have been taken for one.
The woman who got up his linen declared he was more particular over
his shirt-frills than Sir Peter himself.</p>

<p>Strangers in the place would sometimes ask what he was. The
answer was not easy to give. He was a botanist and herbalist, and
made pills, and mixtures, and perfumes, and sold honey, and had built
his cottage and planted out his garden, and lived alone, cooking his
food and waiting on himself; doing all in fact with his own hands, and
was very modest always. On the other side, he had travelled in his
youth, he understood paintings, studied the stars, read his store of Latin
and classical books, and now and then bought more, and was as good a
doctor as Duffham himself. Some people said a better one. Certain
it was, that more than once when legitimate medical nostrums had
failed&mdash;calomel and blisters and bleeding&mdash;Abel Crew&rsquo;s simple decoctions
and leaves had worked a cure. Look at young Mrs. Sterling at
the Court. When that first baby of hers came to town&mdash;and a fine
squalling young brat he was, with a mouth like a crocodile&rsquo;s!&mdash;gatherings
arose in her chest or somewhere, one after another; it was
said the agony was awful. Duffham&rsquo;s skill seemed to have gone a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
blackberrying, the other doctor&rsquo;s also, for neither of the two could do
anything for her, and the Court thought she would have died of it.
Upon that, some relation of old Sterling&rsquo;s was summoned from London&mdash;a
great physician in great practice. He came in answer, and was
liberal with his advice, telling them to try this and to try the other.
But it did no good; and she only grew worse. When they were all in
despair, seeing her increasing weakness and the prolonged pain, the
woman who nursed her spoke of old Abel Crew; she had known him
cure in these cases when the doctor could not; and the poor young
lady, willing to catch at a straw, told them to send for Abel Crew.
Abel Crew took a prepared plaster of herbs with him, green leaves of
some sort, and applied it. That night the patient slept more easily
than she had for weeks; and in a short time was well again.</p>

<p>But, skilful though he seemed to be in the science of herbs, as
remedies for sickness and sores, Abel Crew never obtruded himself
upon the ailing, or took money for his advice, or willingly interfered
with the province of Duffham; he never would do it unless compelled
in the interests of humanity. The patients he chiefly treated were the
poor, those who could not have paid Duffham a coin worth thinking
about. Duffham knew this. And, instead of being jealous of him, as
some medical men might have been, or ridiculing him for a quack,
Duffham liked and respected old Abel Crew. He was simple in his
habits still: living chiefly upon bread and butter, with radishes or
mustard and cress for a relish, cooking vegetables for his dinner, but
rarely meat: and his drink was tea or spring water.</p>

<p>So that Abel Crew was rather a notable character amongst us; and
when it was known abroad that two of his pills had caused the death of
Mrs. Reed&rsquo;s twins, there arose no end of a commotion.</p>

<p>It chanced that the same night this occurred, just about the time in
fact that the unfortunate infants were taking down the pills under the
superintendence of their mother and the blacksmith&rsquo;s wife, Abel Crew
met with an accident; though it was curious enough that it should be
so. In taking a pan of boiling herbs off the fire, he let one of the
handles slip out of his fingers; it sent the pan down on that side,
spilled a lot of the stuff, and scalded his left foot on the instep. Therefore
he was about the last person to hear of the calamity; for his door
was not open as usual the following morning, and no one knocked to
tell him of it.</p>

<p>Duffham was the first. Passing by on his morning rounds, the
doctor heard the comments of the people, and it arrested him. It was
so unusual a thing for Abel Crew not to be about, and for his door to
be closed, that some of them had been arriving at a sensible conclusion&mdash;Abel
Crew, knowing the mischief his pills had done, was shutting
himself up within the house, unable to face his neighbours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; said Duffham. And he strode up the garden-path,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
knocked at the door with his cane, and entered. Abel had dressed, but
was lying down on the bed again to rest his lame foot.</p>

<p>Duffham would have asked to look at it, but that he knew Abel
Crew was as good at burns and scalds as he himself was. It had been
doctored at once, and was now wrapped up in a handkerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fire is nearly out of it,&rdquo; said Abel, &ldquo;but it must have rest; by
to-night I shall be able to dress it with my healing-salve. I am much
obliged to you for coming in, sir: though in truth I don&rsquo;t know how
you could have heard of the accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! news flies,&rdquo; said Duffham, evasively, knowing that he had not
heard of the foot, or the neighbours either, and had come in for something
altogether different. &ldquo;What is this about the pills?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About the pills?&rdquo; repeated Abel Crew, who had got up out of
respect, and was putting on his coat. &ldquo;What pills, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor told him what had happened. Hester Reed had given
one of his pills to each of her babies, and both had died of it. Abel
Crew listened quietly; his face and his eyes fixed on Duffham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The children cannot have died of the pills,&rdquo; said he, speaking as
gently as you please. &ldquo;Something else must have killed them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;According to Hester Reed&rsquo;s account, nothing can have done it but
the pills,&rdquo; said Duffham. &ldquo;The children had only taken their ordinary
food throughout the day, and very little of that. George Reed came
running to me in the night, but it was too late; one was dead before I
got there. There could be no mistaking the children&rsquo;s symptoms&mdash;that
both were poisoned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is very strange,&rdquo; exclaimed Abel, looking troubled. &ldquo;By
what kind of poison?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arsenic, I think. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But here they were interrupted. Dovey, the blacksmith, hearing
of the calamity, together with the fact that it was his wife who had
assisted in administering the suspected doses, deemed it his duty to
look into the affair a little, and to resent it. He had left his forge and
a bar of iron red-hot in it, and come tearing along in his leather apron,
his shirt-sleeves stripped up to the elbow, and his arms grimy. A
dark-eyed, good-natured little man in general, was Dovey, but exploding
with rage at the present moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now then, Abel Crew, what do you mean by selling pills to poison
people?&rdquo; demanded he, pushing back the door with a bang, and
stepping in fiercely. Duffham, foreseeing there was going to be a
contest, and having no time to waste, took his departure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not sold pills to poison people,&rdquo; replied Abel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Dovey, folding his black arms. &ldquo;Be you going
to eat them pills, or be you not? Come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Dovey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do I mean! Ain&rsquo;t my meaning plain? Do you own to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
having selled a box of pills to Hester Reed last winter?&mdash;be you
thinking to eat that there fact, and deny of it? Come, Abel Crew!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember it well,&rdquo; readily spoke up Abel. &ldquo;Mrs. Reed came
here one day, complaining that her head ached continually, and her
side often had a dull pain in it, and asked me to give her something.
I did so; I gave her a box of pills. It was early in January, I think.
I know there was ice on the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then do you own to them pills,&rdquo; returned Dovey, more quietly, his
fierceness subdued by Abel&rsquo;s civility. &ldquo;It were you that furnished &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I furnished the box of pills I speak of, that Hester Reed had
from me in the winter. There&rsquo;s no mistake about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And made &rsquo;em too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and made them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say that; and now don&rsquo;t you go for to
eat your words later, Abel Crew. Our Ann, my wife, helped to give
them there two pills to the children; and I&rsquo;m not a-going to let her
get into trouble over it. You&rsquo;ve confessed to the pills, and I&rsquo;m a
witness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My pills did not kill the children, Dovey,&rdquo; said Abel, in a pleasant
tone, resting his lame foot upon an opposite chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not kill &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that they did not. I&rsquo;ve not made pills all these years to poison
children at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what done it if the pills didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I say? &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t my pills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Duffham says it was the pills. And he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Duffham says it was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reed telled me that the doctor asked outright, all in a flurry, what
his wife had gave the babies, and she said she had gave &rsquo;em nothing
but them there two pills of Abel Crew&rsquo;s. Duffham said the pills must
have had poison in &rsquo;em, and he asked for the box; and Hester Reed,
she give him the box, and he sealed it up afore their eyes with his own
seal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abel nodded. He knew that any suspected medicine must in such a
case be sealed up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now that I&rsquo;ve got that there word from ye, I&rsquo;ll say good-day
to ye, neighbour, for I&rsquo;ve left my forge to itself, and some red-hot iron
in it. And I hope with all my heart and mind,&rdquo;&mdash;the blacksmith
turned round from the door to say more kindly, his good-nature
cropping up again,&mdash;&ldquo;that it&rsquo;ll turn out it <em>warn&rsquo;t</em> the pills, but some&rsquo;at
else: our Ann won&rsquo;t have no cause to be in a fright then.&rdquo; Which
was as much as to say that Ann Dovey was frightened, you observe.</p>

<p>That same afternoon, going past the common, I saw Abel Crew in
his garden, sitting against the cottage wall in the sun, his foot resting
on a block of wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How did it all happen, Abel?&rdquo; I asked, turning in at the gate.
&ldquo;Did you give Mrs. Reed the wrong pills?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I gave her the right pills; the pills I make
expressly for such complaints as hers. But if I had, in one sense, given
her the wrong, they could not have brought about any ill effect such as
this, for my pills are all innocent of poison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say it could not have been the pills that did the mischief,
after all, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might swear it as well, Master Johnny, with perfect safety.
What killed the poor children, I don&rsquo;t pretend to know, but my pills
never did. I tried to get down as far as Reed&rsquo;s to inquire particulars,
and found I could not walk. It was a bit of ill-luck, disabling myself
just at this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall you have to appear at the inquest to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lifted his head quickly at the question&mdash;as though it surprised
him. Perhaps not having cast his thoughts that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there to be an inquest, Master Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard so from old Jones. He has gone over to see the coroner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wish the investigation was all over and done with,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;It makes me uneasy, though I know I am innocent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking at him sitting there in the sun, at his beautiful face with
its truthful eyes and its silver hair, it was next to impossible to believe
he could be the author of the two children&rsquo;s death. Only&mdash;the best of
us are liable to mistakes, and sometimes make them. I said as much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> made none, Master Johnny,&rdquo; was his answer. &ldquo;When my pills
come to be analyzed&mdash;as of course they must be&mdash;they will be found
wholesome and innocent.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>The inquest did not take place till the Friday. Old Jones had fixed
it for the Thursday, but the coroner put it off to the next day. And by
the time Friday morning dawned, opinion had veered round, and was
strongly in favour of Abel Crew. All the parish had been to see him;
and his protestations, that he had never in his life put any kind of
poison into his medicines, made a great impression. The pills could
not have been in fault, said everybody. Dr. Duffham might have
sealed them up as a matter of precaution, but the mischief would not
be found there.</p>

<p>In the middle of Church Dykely, next door to Perkins the butcher&rsquo;s,
stood the Silver Bear Inn; a better sort of public-house, kept by Henry
Rimmer. It was there that the inquest was held. Henry Rimmer
himself and Perkins the butcher were two of the jurymen. Dobbs the
blacksmith was another. They all dressed themselves in their Sunday-going
clothes to attend it. It was called for two in the afternoon; and
soon after that hour the county coroner (who had dashed up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Silver Bear in a fast gig, his clerk driving) and the jury trooped down
to George Reed&rsquo;s cottage and took a look at the two pale little faces
lying there side by side. Then they went back again, and the proceedings
began.</p>

<p>Of course as many spectators went crowding into the room as it
would hold. Three or four chairs were there (besides those occupied
by the jury at the table), and a bench stood against the wall. The
bench was speedily fought for and filled; but Henry Rimmer&rsquo;s brother,
constituting himself master of the ceremonies, reserved the chairs for
what he called the &ldquo;big people,&rdquo; meaning those of importance in the
place. The Squire was bowed into one; and to my surprise I had
another. Why, I could not imagine, unless it was that they remembered
I was the owner of George Reed&rsquo;s cottage. But I did not like to
sit down when so many older persons were standing, and I would not
take the chair.</p>

<p>Some little time was occupied with preliminaries before what might
be called the actual inquest set in. First of all, the coroner flew into a
passion because Abel Crew had not put in an appearance, asking old
Jones if he supposed that was the way justice must be administered in
England, and that he ought to have had Crew present. Old Jones who
was in a regular fluster with it all, and his legs more gouty than ever,
told the coroner, calling him &ldquo;his worship,&rdquo; that he had understood
Crew meant to be present. Upon which the coroner sharply answered
that &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; went for nothing, and Jones should know his
business better.</p>

<p>However, in walked Abel Crew in the midst of the contest. His
delayed arrival was caused by his difficulty in getting his damaged foot
there; which had been accomplished by the help of a stick and somebody&rsquo;s
arm. Abel had dressed himself in his black velvet suit; and as
he took off his hat on entering and bowed respectfully to the coroner,
I declare he could not be taken for anything but a courtly gentleman
of the old school. Nobody offered him a chair. I wished I had not
given up mine: he should have had it.</p>

<p>Evidence was first tendered of the death of the children, and of the
terrible pain they had died in. Duffham and a medical man, who was
a stranger and had helped at the post-mortem, testified to arsenic being
the cause of death. The next question was, how had it been administered?
A rumour arose in the room that the pills had been analyzed;
but the result had not transpired. Every one could see a small paper
parcel standing on the table before the coroner, and knew by its shape
that it must contain the pill-box.</p>

<p>Hester Reed was called. She said (giving her evidence very quietly,
just a sob and a sigh every now and then alone betraying what she felt)
that she was the wife of George Reed. Her two little ones&mdash;twins,
aged eleven months and a half&mdash;had been ailing for a day or two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
seemed feverish, would not eat their food, were very cross at times
and unnaturally still at others, and she came to the conclusion that
their teeth must be plaguing them, and thought she would give them
some mild physic. Mrs. Todhetley, the Squire&rsquo;s lady at Dyke Manor,
had called in on the Tuesday afternoon, and agreed with her that some
mild physic&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Confine your statement to what is evidence,&rdquo; interrupted the
coroner, sternly.</p>

<p>Hester Reed, looking scared at the check, and perhaps not knowing
what was evidence and what not, went on the best way she could. She
and Ann Dovey&mdash;who had been neighbourly enough to look in and
help her&mdash;had given the children a pill apiece in the evening after they
were undressed, mashing the pill up in a little sugar and warm water.
She then put them to bed upstairs and went to bed herself not long
after. In the night she and her husband were awoke by the babies&rsquo;
screams, and they thought it must be convulsions. Her husband
lighted the fire and ran for Dr. Duffham; but one had died before
the doctor could get there, and the other died close upon it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What food had you given them during the day?&rdquo; asked the
coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very little indeed, sir. They wouldn&rsquo;t take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did the little that they did take consist of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It were soaked bread, sir, with milk and some sprinkled sugar. I
tried them with some potato mashed up in a spoonful o&rsquo; broth at
midday&mdash;we&rsquo;d had a bit o&rsquo; biled neck o&rsquo; mutton for dinner&mdash;but they
both turned from it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then all they took that day was bread soaked in milk and
sweetened with sugar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it were, sir. But the bread was soaked in warm water and
the milk and sugar was put in afterwards. &rsquo;Twas but the veriest
morsel they&rsquo;d take, poor little dears!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was the bread&mdash;and the milk&mdash;and the sugar, the same that the
rest of your household used?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In course it were, sir. My other children ate plenty of it. <em>Their</em>
appetites didn&rsquo;t fail &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you get the warm water from that you say you soaked
the bread in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out o&rsquo; the tea-kettle, sir. The water was the same that I biled for
our tea morning and night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The deceased children, then, had absolutely no food given to them
apart from what you had yourselves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a scrap, sir. Not a drop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except the pills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excepting them, in course, sir. None o&rsquo; the rest of us wanted
physic.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you procure these pills?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went into the history of the pills. Giving the full account of
them, as already related.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By your own showing, witness, it must be three months, or thereabouts,
since you had that box from Abel Crew,&rdquo; spoke the coroner.
&ldquo;How do you know that the two pills you administered to the deceased
children came from the same box?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hester Reed&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. She looked as surprised as though
she had been asked whether she had procured the two pills from the
moon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; interposed one of the jury, &ldquo;how do you know it was the
same box?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, gentlemen, I had no other box of pills at all, save that,&rdquo; she
said, when her speech came to her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had no physic but that
in the cottage since winter, nor for ever so long afore. I&rsquo;ll swear it
was the same box, sirs; there can&rsquo;t be no mistake about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you leave it about in the way of people?&rdquo; resumed the coroner.
&ldquo;So that it might be handled by anybody who might come into your
cottage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; she answered, earnestly. &ldquo;I never kept the pill-box but
in one place, and that was on the top of the high press upstairs out of
harm&rsquo;s way. I put it there the first night Abel Crew gave it me, and
when I wanted to get a pill or two out for my own taking, I used to
step on a chair&mdash;for it&rsquo;s too high for me to reach without&mdash;and help
myself. The box have never been took from the place at all, sir, till
Tuesday night, when I brought it downstairs with me. When I&rsquo;ve
wanted to dust the press-top, I&rsquo;ve just lifted the pill-box with one hand
and passed the duster along under it with the other, as I stood on the
chair. It&rsquo;s the same box, sir; I&rsquo;ll swear to that much; and it&rsquo;s the
same pills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strong testimony. The coroner paused a moment. &ldquo;You swear
that, you say? You are quite sure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, I am sure and positive. The box was never took from its place
since Abel Crew gave it me, till I reached up for it on Tuesday evening
and carried it downstairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had been in the habit of taking these pills yourself, you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took two three or four times when I first had &rsquo;em, sir; once I
took three; but since then I&rsquo;ve felt better and not wanted any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you feel any inconvenience from them? Any pain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit, sir. As I said to Ann Dovey that night, when she asked
whether they was fit pills to give the children, they seemed as mild as
milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should you know the box again, witness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Law yes, sir, what should hinder me?&rdquo; returned Hester Reed,
inwardly marvelling at what seemed so superfluous a question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The coroner undid the paper, and handed the box to her. She was
standing close to him, on the other side his clerk&mdash;who sat writing down
the evidence. &ldquo;Is this the box?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Look at it well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Reed did as she was bid: turned it about and looked &ldquo;well.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes, sir, it is the same box,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;That is, I am nearly sure
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by <em>nearly</em> sure?&rdquo; quickly asked the coroner,
catching at the word. &ldquo;Have you any doubt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not no moral doubt at all, sir. Only them pill-boxes is all so like
one another. Yes, sir, I&rsquo;m sure it is the same box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open it, and look at the pills. Are they, in your judgment, the
same?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the same, sir,&rdquo; she answered, after taking off the lid. &ldquo;One
might a&rsquo;most know&rsquo;em anywhere. Only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only what?&rdquo; demanded the coroner, as she paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I fancied I had rather more left&mdash;six or seven say.
There&rsquo;s only five here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The coroner made no answer to that. He took the box from her
and put on the lid. We soon learnt that two had been taken out for
the purpose of being analyzed.</p>

<p>For who should loom into the room at that juncture but Pettipher,
the druggist from Piefinch Cut. He had been analyzing the pills in a
hasty way in obedience to orders received half-an-hour ago, and came
to give the result. The pills contained arsenic, he said; not enough
to kill a grown person, he thought, but enough to kill a child. As
Pettipher was only a small man (in a business point of view) and sold
groceries as well as drugs, and spectacles and ear-trumpets, some of us
did not think much of his opinion, and fancied the pills should have
been analyzed by Duffham. That was just like old Jones: giving work
to the wrong man.</p>

<p>George Reed was questioned, but could tell nothing, except that he
had never touched either box or pills. While Ann Dovey was being
called, and the coroner had his head bent over his clerk&rsquo;s notes, speaking
to him in an undertone, Abel Crew suddenly asked to be allowed
to look at the pills. The coroner, without lifting his head, just pushed
the box down on the green cloth; and one of the jury handed it over
his shoulder to Abel Crew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is not the box I gave Mrs. Reed,&rdquo; said Abel, in a clear, firm
tone, after diving into it with his eyes and nose. &ldquo;Nor are these the
pills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Up went the coroner&rsquo;s head with a start. He had supposed the
request to see the box came from a juryman. It might have been
irregular for Abel Crew to be allowed so much; but as it arose partly
through the coroner&rsquo;s own fault, he was too wise to make a commotion
over it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that you say?&rdquo; he asked, stretching out his hand for the
box as eagerly as though it had contained gold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That this box and these pills are not the same that I furnished to
Mrs. Reed, sir,&rdquo; replied Abel, advancing and placing the box in the
coroner&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;They are not indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the same pills and box!&rdquo; exclaimed the coroner. &ldquo;Why,
man, you have heard the evidence of the witness, Hester Reed; you
may see for yourself that she spoke nothing but truth. Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they are <em>not</em> the same, sir,&rdquo; respectfully persisted Abel. &ldquo;I
know my own pills, and I know my own boxes: these are neither the
one nor the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that won&rsquo;t do; you must take us all for fools!&rdquo; exploded the
coroner, who was a man of quick temper. &ldquo;Just you stand back and
be quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never a pill-box went out from my hands, sir, but it had my
little private mark upon it,&rdquo; urged Abel. &ldquo;That box does not bear
the mark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the mark, pray?&rdquo; asked the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four little dots of ink inside the rim of the lid, sir; and four similar
dots inside the box near the edge. They are so faint that a casual
observer might not notice them; but they are always there. Of all the
pill-boxes now in my house, sir&mdash;and I suppose there may be two or
three dozen of them&mdash;you will not find one but has the mark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some whispering had been going on in different parts of the room;
but this silenced it. You might have heard a pin drop. The words
seemed to make an impression on the coroner: they and Abel Crew
were both so earnest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You assert also that the pills are not yours,&rdquo; spoke the coroner,
who was known to be fond of desultory conversations while holding his
inquests. &ldquo;What proof have you of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No proof; that is, no proof that I can advance, that would satisfy
the eye or ear. But I am certain, by the look of them, that those were
never my pills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this took the jury aback; the coroner also. It had seemed to
some of them an odd thing that Hester Reed should have swallowed
two or three of the pills at once without their entailing an ache or a
pain, and that one each had poisoned the babies. Perkins the butcher
observed to the coroner that the box must have been changed since
Mrs. Reed helped herself from it. Upon which the coroner, after
pulling at his whiskers for a moment as if in thought, called out for
Mrs. Reed to return.</p>

<p>But when she did so, and was further questioned, she only kept to
what she had said before, strenuously denying that the box <em>could</em> have
been changed. It had never been touched by any hands but her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
while it stood in its place on the press, and had never been removed
from it at all until she took it downstairs on the past Tuesday night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the room where this press stands your own sleeping-room?&rdquo;
asked the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. It&rsquo;s the other room, where my three children sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could these children get to the box?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear no, sir! &rsquo;Twould be quite impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had any one an opportunity of handling the box when you took it
down on Tuesday night?&rdquo; went on the coroner after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only Mrs. Dovey, sir. Nobody else was there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she touch it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She laid hold of it to look at the pills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you leave her <em>alone</em> with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. Leastways&mdash;yes, I did for a minute or so, while I went
into the back&rsquo;us to get the sugar and a saucer and spoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had she the box in her hands when you returned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I think she had. I think she was still smelling at the
pills. I know the poor little innocents was lying one on one knee, and
one on t&rsquo;other, all flat, and her two hands was lifted with the box in
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was after that that you took the pills out of it to give the
children?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; directly after. But Ann Dovey wouldn&rsquo;t do nothing
wrong to the pills, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said the coroner in his curt way. &ldquo;Call Ann
Dovey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ann Dovey walked forward with a face as red as her new bonnet-strings.
She had heard the whole colloquy: something seemed, too,
to have put her out. Possessing scant veneration for coroners at the
best of times, and none for the jury at present assembled, she did not
feel disposed to keep down her temper.</p>

<p>The few first questions asked her, however, afforded no opportunity
for resentment, for they were put quietly, and tended only to extract
confirmation of Mrs. Reed&rsquo;s evidence, as to fetching the pill-box from
upstairs and administering the pills. Then the coroner cleared his
throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see the last witness, Hester Reed, go into the back
kitchen for a spoon and saucer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw her go and fetch &rsquo;em from somewhere,&rdquo; replied Ann Dovey,
who felt instinctively the ball was beginning, and gave the reins to her
temper accordingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you take charge of the pill-box while she was gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had it in my hand, if you mean that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did anybody come into the kitchen during that interval?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No they didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the tart response.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You were alone, except for the two infants?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I were. What of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, witness, did you do anything with that box? Did you, for
instance, exchange it for another?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you ought to be ashamed o&rsquo; yourselves, all on you, to sit
and ask a body such a thing!&rdquo; exploded Mrs. Dovey, growing every
moment more resentful, at being questioned. &ldquo;If I had knowed the
bother that was to spring up, I&rsquo;d have chucked the box, pills and all,
into the fire first. I wish I had!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was the box, that you handed to Hester Reed on her return, the
same box she left with you? Were the pills the same pills?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, where d&rsquo;ye think I could have got another box from?&rdquo;
shrieked Ann Dovey. &ldquo;D&rsquo;you suppose, sir, I carry boxes and pills
about with me? I bain&rsquo;t so fond o&rsquo; physic as all that comes to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dovey takes pills on occasion for that giddiness of his; I&rsquo;ve seen
him take &rsquo;em; mayhap you&rsquo;d picked up a box of his,&rdquo; spoke Dobbs
the blacksmith, mildly.</p>

<p>That was adding fuel to fire. Two of a trade don&rsquo;t agree. Dovey
and Dobbs were both blacksmiths: the one in Church Dykely; the
other in Piefinch Cut, not much more, so to say, than a stone&rsquo;s-throw
from each other. The men were good friends enough; but their
respective ladies were apt to regard jealously all work taken to the
rival establishment. Any other of the jurymen might have made the
remark with comparative impunity; not so Dobbs. And, besides the
turn the inquiry seemed to be taking, Mrs. Dovey had not been easy
about it in her mind from the first; proof of which was furnished by
the call, already mentioned, made by her husband on Abel Crew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dovey takes pills on occasion, do he!&rdquo; she shrilly retorted. &ldquo;And
what do you take, Bill Dobbs? Pints o&rsquo; beer when you can get &rsquo;em.
Who lamed Poole&rsquo;s white horse the t&rsquo;other day a-shoeing him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; sternly interrupted the coroner. While Dobbs, conscious
of the self-importance imparted to him by the post he was now filling,
and of the necessity of maintaining the dignity of demeanour which he
was apt to put on with his best clothes, bore the aspersion with
equanimity and a stolid face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Attend to me, witness, and confine yourself to replying to the
questions I put to you,&rdquo; continued the coroner. &ldquo;Did you take with
you any pills or pill-box of your own when you went to Mrs. Reed&rsquo;s
that evening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em>,&rdquo; returned Ann Dovey, the emphasis culminating in a
sob: and why she should have set on to shiver and shake was more
than the jury could understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you wear pockets?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if I do?&rdquo; she said, after a momentary pause. But her lips
grew white, and I thought she was trying to brave it out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Had you a pocket on that evening?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven be good to me!&rdquo; I heard her mutter under her breath.
And if ever I saw a woman look frightened nearly to death, Ann
Dovey looked it then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had you a pocket on that evening, witness?&rdquo; repeated the coroner,
sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;es.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What articles were in it? Do you recollect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It were a key or two,&rdquo; came the answer at length, her very teeth
chattering and all the impudence suddenly gone out of her. &ldquo;And my
thimble, sir;&mdash;and some coppers; and a part of a nutmeg;&mdash;and&mdash;and
I don&rsquo;t remember nothing else, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No box of pills? You are sure you had not that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I said so, sir?&rdquo; she rejoined, bursting into a flood of tears.
For which, and for the sudden agitation, nobody could see any reason:
and perhaps it was only that which made the coroner harp upon the
same string. Her demeanour had become suspicious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had no poison of any kind in your pocket, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he asked the question in jest more than earnest. For when she
went into hysterics instead of replying, he let her go. He was used to
seeing witnesses scared when brought before him.</p>

<p>The verdict was not arrived at that day. When other witnesses
had been examined, the coroner addressed the jury. Ten of them
listened deferentially, and were quite prepared to return a verdict of
Manslaughter against Abel Crew; seemed red-hot to do it, in fact.
But two of them dissented. They were not satisfied, they said; and
they held out for adjourning the inquest to see if any more light could
be thrown upon the affair. As they evidently had the room with
them, the coroner yielded, and adjourned the inquest in a temper.</p>

<p>And then it was discovered that the name was not Crew but Carew.
Abel himself corrected the coroner. Upon that, the coroner sharply
demanded why he had lived under a false name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, sir,&rdquo; replied Abel, as dignified as you please, &ldquo;I have had no
intention of doing so. When I first came to this neighbourhood I gave
my name correctly&mdash;Carew: but the people at once converted it into
Crew by their mode of pronunciation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any rate, you must have sanctioned it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tacitly I have done so. What did it signify? When I have had
occasion to write my name&mdash;but that has been very rare&mdash;I have
written it Carew. Old Sir Peter Chavasse knew it was Carew, and
used to call me so; as did Sir Geoffry. Indeed, sir, I have had no
reason to conceal my name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; said the coroner, cutting him short. &ldquo;Stand
back, Abel Carew. The proceedings are adjourned to this day week.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l1" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>


<h2><span class="f9">IV.</span><br />

ABEL CREW.</h2>


<p>Things are done in remote country places that would not be done in
towns. Whether the law is understood by us, or whether it is not, it
often happens that it is very much exceeded, or otherwise not acted
upon. Those who have to exercise it sometimes show themselves as
ignorant of it as if they had lived all their lives in the wilds of America.</p>

<p>Old Jones the constable was one of these. When not checked by
his masters, the magistrates, he would do most outrageous things&mdash;speaking
of the law and of common sense. And he did one in
reference to Abel Crew. I still say Crew. Though it had come out
that his name was Carew, we should be sure to call him Crew to the
end.</p>

<p>The inquest might have been concluded at its first sitting, but for
the two who stood out against the rest of the jury. Perkins the butcher
and Dobbs the blacksmith. Truth to say, these two had plenty of
intelligence; which could not be said of all the rest. Ten of the jury
pronounced the case to be as clear as daylight: the infants had been
poisoned by Abel Crew&rsquo;s pills: and the coroner seemed to agree with
them&mdash;he hated trouble. But Dobbs and Perkins held out. They
were not satisfied, they said; the pills furnished by Abel Crew might
not have been the pills that were taken by the children; moreover,
they considered that the pills should be &ldquo;more officially&rdquo; analyzed.
Pettipher the druggist was all very well in his small way, but hardly
up, in their opinion, to pronouncing upon pills when a man&rsquo;s life or
liberty was at stake. They pressed for an adjournment, that the pills
might be examined by some competent authority. The coroner, as
good as telling them they were fools to their faces, had adjourned the
inquest in suppressed passion to that day week.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got to take care of you, Abel Crew,&rdquo; said old Jones,
floundering up on his gouty legs to Abel as the jury and crowd
dispersed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to come along o&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To come where?&rdquo; asked Abel, who was hobbling towards home
on his scalded foot, by the help of his stick and the arm of Gibbon the
gamekeeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the lock-up,&rdquo; said old Jones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;To the lock-up!&rdquo; echoed Abel Crew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In course,&rdquo; returned old Jones. &ldquo;Where else but the lock-up?
Did you think it was to the pound?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abel Crew, lifting the hand that held his stick to brush a speck of
dirt off his handsome velvet coat, turned to the constable; his refined
face, a little paler than usual, gazing inquiringly at old Jones&rsquo;s, his
silver hair glistening in the setting sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, Mr. Jones,&rdquo; he said calmly. &ldquo;You cannot
mean to lock me up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; cried old Jones, who had a knack of considering
every suspected person guilty, and treating them accordingly. &ldquo;You
have a cheek, you have, Abel Crew! &lsquo;Not going to take me to the
lock-up, Mr. Jones,&rsquo; says you! Where would you be took to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no necessity for it,&rdquo; said Abel. &ldquo;I shall not run
away. I shall be in my house if I&rsquo;m wanted again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you would!&rdquo; said old Jones, ironically. &ldquo;You might
or you mightn&rsquo;t, you know. You be as good as committed for the
killing and slaying o&rsquo; them there two twins, and it&rsquo;s my business to see
as you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> make your escape aforehand, Abel Crew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quite a company of us, sauntering out of the inquest-room, were
listening by this time. I gave old Jones a bit of my mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is not yet committed, Jones, therefore you have no right to
take him or to lock him up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know nothing about it, Mr. Ludlow. I do. The
crowner gave me a hint, and I&rsquo;m acting on it. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you go and let
that man escape,&rsquo; says his worship to me: &lsquo;it&rsquo;ll be at your peril if you
do.&rsquo; &lsquo;<em>I&rsquo;ll</em> see to him, your worship,&rsquo; says I. And I be a-doing
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was hardly likely that the coroner meant Abel Crew to be
confined in that precious lock-up for a whole week. One night there
was bad enough. At least, I did not think he meant it; but the crowd,
to judge by their comments, seemed divided on the point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The shortest way to settle the question will be to ask the coroner,
old Jones,&rdquo; said I, turning back to the Silver Bear. &ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be clever to catch him, Master Johnny,&rdquo; roared out old
Jones after me. &ldquo;His worship jumped into his gig; it was a-waiting
for him when he come out; and his clerk druv him off at a slapping
pace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was true. The coroner was gone; and old Jones had it all his
own way; for, you see, none of us liked to interfere with the edict of
an official gentleman who held sway in the county and sat on dead
people. Abel Crew accepted the alternative meekly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any way, you must allow me to go home first to lock my house
up, and to see to one or two other little matters,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless you goes under my own eyes,&rdquo; retorted old Jones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
&ldquo;You might be for destroying your stock o&rsquo; pills for fear they should
bear evidence again&rsquo; you, Abel Crew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My pills are, of all things, what I would not destroy,&rdquo; said Abel.
&ldquo;They would bear testimony for me, instead of against me, for they
are harmless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Abel Crew hobbled to his cottage on the common, attended by
old Jones and a tail of followers. Arrived there, he attended the first
thing to his scalded foot, dressing it with some of his own ointment.
Then he secured some bread and butter, not knowing what the accommodation
at the lock-up might be in the shape of eatables, and changed
his handsome quaint suit of clothes for those he wore every day. After
that, he was escorted back to the lock-up.</p>

<p>Now, the lock-up was in Piefinch Cut, nearly opposite to Dovey the
blacksmith&rsquo;s. The Squire remembered the time when the lock-up stood
alone; when Piefinch Cut had no more houses in it than Piefinch Lane
now has; but since then Piefinch Cut had been built upon and inhabited;
houses touching even the sacred walls of the lock-up. A
tape-and-cotton and sweetstuff shop supported it on one side, and a
small pork-butcher&rsquo;s on the other. Pettipher&rsquo;s drug shop, should
anybody be curious on the point, was next to the tape-and-cotton
mart.</p>

<p>To see Abel Crew arriving in the custody of old Jones the constable,
the excited stragglers after them, astonished Piefinch Cut not a little.
Figg the pawnbroker&mdash;who was originally from Alcester&mdash;considered
himself learned in the law. Anyway, he was a great talker, and liked
to give his opinion upon every topic that might turn up. His shop
joined Dovey&rsquo;s forge: and when we arrived there, Figg was outside,
holding forth to Dovey, who had his shirt-sleeves rolled up above his
elbows as usual, his leather apron on. Mrs. Dovey stood listening
behind, in the smart gown and red-ribboned bonnet she had worn at
the inquest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what on earth!&mdash;have they been and gone and took up
Crew?&rdquo; cried Figg in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an awful shame of old Jones,&rdquo; I broke in; speaking more to
Dovey than Figg, for Figg was no favourite of mine. &ldquo;A whole week
of the lock-up! Only think of it, Dovey!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But have they brought it in again&rsquo; him, Master Johnny?&rdquo; cried
Dovey, unfolding his grimy arms to touch his paper cap to me as he
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>No</em>; that&rsquo;s what they have not done. The inquest is adjourned
for a week; and I don&rsquo;t believe old Jones has a right to take him at
all. Not legally, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what her brought word,&rdquo; said Dovey, with a nod in the
direction of his wife. &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, how be it turned, Ann?&rsquo; says I to her
when her come back&mdash;for I&rsquo;d a sight o&rsquo; work in to-day and couldn&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
go myself. &lsquo;Oh, it haven&rsquo;t turned no ways yet, Jack,&rsquo; says her; &lsquo;it be
put off to next week.&rsquo; There he goes! right in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This last remark applied to Abel Crew. After fumbling in his pocket
for the two big keys, tied together with string, and then fumbling at
the latch, old Jones succeeded in opening the door. Not being much
used, the lock was apt to grow rusty. Then he stood back, and with a
flourish of hands motioned Abel in. He made no resistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must know for certain as &rsquo;twere his pills what done it,&rdquo; struck
in Mrs. Dovey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, I do not think it was his
pills. Abel Crew says he never put poison in his pills yet, and I
believe him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and no more it don&rsquo;t stand to reason as he would, Mr.
Ludlow,&rdquo; said Figg, a man whose self-complaisance was not to be put
down by any amount of discouragement. &ldquo;I were just a-saying so to
Dovey&mdash;&mdash; Why have old Jones took him up?&rdquo; went on Figg to
Gibbon the gamekeeper, who came striding by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jones says he has the coroner&rsquo;s orders for it,&rdquo; answered Gibbon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, I know a bit about law, and I know a man oughtn&rsquo;t
to be shut up till some charge is brought again&rsquo; him,&rdquo; contended
Figg. &ldquo;Crew&rsquo;s pills is suspected, but he have not been charged
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;s what Jones has gone and done,&rdquo; said Gibbon.
&ldquo;Perhaps he is right. And a week&rsquo;s not much; it&rsquo;ll soon pass. But
as to any pills of Abel Crew&rsquo;s having killed them children, it&rsquo;s just preposterous
to think of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye suppose did kill &rsquo;em, then, Richard Gibbon?&rdquo; demanded
Ann Dovey, a hot flush on her face, her tone full of resentment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what has to be found out,&rdquo; returned Gibbon, passing on
his way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for Dobbs and Butcher Perkins holding out again&rsquo;
it, Crew &rsquo;ud ha&rsquo; been brought in guilty safe enough,&rdquo; said Ann Dovey.
And the tone was again so excited, so bitterly resentful against Dobbs
and Perkins, that I could not help looking at her in wonder. It sounded
just as though the non-committal of Abel were a wrong inflicted upon
herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he would not have been brought in guilty,&rdquo; I answered her;
&ldquo;he would have been committed for trial; but that&rsquo;s a different thing.
If the matter could be sifted to the bottom, I know it would be found
that the mischief did not lie with Abel Crew&rsquo;s pills. There, Mrs.
Dovey!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was looking at me out of the corners of her eyes&mdash;for all the
world as if she were afraid of me, or of what I said. I could not make
her out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should you wish so particularly to bring it home to Crew?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
I pointedly asked her; and Figg turned round to look at her, as if
seconding the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me want particular to bring it home to Crew!&rdquo; she retorted, her
voice rising with temper; or perhaps with fear, for she trembled like
an aspen leaf. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to bring it home particular to him, Mr.
Ludlow. It were his pills, though, all the same, that did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that she whisked through the forge to her kitchen.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>On the morning following I got old Jones to let me into the lock-up.
The place consisted of two rooms opening into one another, and a small
square space, no bigger than a closet, at the end of the passage, where
they kept the pen and ink. For that small space had a window in it,
looking on to the fields at the back; the two rooms had only skylights
in the roof. In the inner room a narrow iron bedstead stood against
the wall, a mattress and blanket on it. Abel was sitting on that when
we went in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have been lively here last night, Abel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, very, sir,&rdquo; answered he, with a half-smile. &ldquo;I did not really
mind it; I am used to be alone. I could have done with fewer rats,
though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, are there rats here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lots of them, Master Johnny. I don&rsquo;t like rats. They came upon
my face, and all about me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does old Jones not set traps for them? He considers this
place to be under his special protection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are too many for any trap to catch,&rdquo; answered Abel.</p>

<p>Old Jones had gone off to the desk in the closet, having placed some
bread and butter and milk on the shelf for Abel. His errand there was
to enter the cost of the bread in the account-book, to be settled for
later. A prisoner in the lock-up was commonly treated to bread and
water: old Jones had graciously allowed this one to pay for some
butter and milk out of his own pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to treat &rsquo;em harsher nor I be obliged, Master Ludlow,&rdquo;
he said to me, when coming in, in reference to the butter and the milk
he was carrying. &ldquo;Abel Crew have been known as a decent man ever
since he come among us: and if he chooses to pay for the butter and
the milk, there ain&rsquo;t no law against his having &rsquo;em. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t as if he was
a burglar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he is not a burglar,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;And you must mind that
you do not get into the wrong box about him. There&rsquo;s neither law
nor justice in locking him up, Jones, before he is charged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had never locked up nobody till they was charged, I should
ha&rsquo; been in the wrong box many a time afore now,&rdquo; said old Jones,
doggedly. &ldquo;Look at that there man last Christmas; what I caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
prowling in the grounds at Parrifer Hall, with a whole set of house-breaking
things concealed in his pockets! After I&rsquo;d took him, and
lodged him in here safe, it was found that he was one o&rsquo; the worst
characters in the county, only let out o&rsquo; Worcester goal two days before.
Suppose I&rsquo;d not took him, Master Johnny? where &rsquo;ud the spoons at
Parrifer Hall ha&rsquo; been?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a different case altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> know what I&rsquo;m about,&rdquo; returned Jones. &ldquo;The coroner, he just
give me a nod or two, looking at Crew as he give it. I knew what it
meant, sir: a nod&rsquo;s as good as a wink to a blind horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anyway, Jones had him, here in the lock-up: and had gone off to
enter the loaf in the account-book; and I was sitting on the bench
opposite Abel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a wicked shame of them to have put you here, Abel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not legal&mdash;as I believe,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;And I am sure it
is not just, sir. I swear those pills and that box produced at the inquest
were none of mine. They never went out of my hands. Old Jones
thinks he is doing right to secure me, I suppose, and he is civil over
it; so I must not grumble. He brought me some water to wash in
this morning, and a comb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no <em>sense</em> in it. You would not attempt to escape; you
would wait for the reassembling of the inquest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Escape!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I should be the first to remain for it.
I am more anxious than any one to have the matter investigated.
Truth to say, Master Johnny, my curiosity is excited. Hester Reed
is so persistent in regard to their being the pills and box that I gave
her; and as she is a truthful honest woman, one can&rsquo;t see where the
mistake lies. There must be a mystery in it somewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you are committed to take your trial? And found
guilty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I shall be committed, I look upon as certain,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;As to being found guilty&mdash;if I am, I must bear it. God knows my
innocence, and I shall hope that in time He will bring it to light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the same, Abel, they ought not to put you in here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then there will be the lying in prison until the assizes&mdash;two
or three good months to come! Don&rsquo;t go and die of it, Abel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I shall not do that,&rdquo; he answered, smiling a little. &ldquo;The consciousness
of innocence will keep me up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sat looking at him. What light could get in through the dusty
skylight fell on his silver hair, which fell back from his pale face. He
held his head down in thought, only raising it to answer me. Some
movement in the closet betokened old Jones&rsquo;s speedy approach, and
I hastened to assure Abel that all sensible people would not doubt his
innocence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No one need doubt it, Master Johnny,&rdquo; he answered firmly, his
eye kindling. &ldquo;I never had a grain of arsenic in my house; I have
never had any other poison. There are herbs from which poison may
be distilled, but I have never gathered them. When it comes to people
needing poison&mdash;and there are some diseases of the human frame that
it may be good for&mdash;they should go to a qualified medical man, not to
a herbalist. No. I have never, never had poison or poisonous herbs
withing my dwelling; therefore (putting other reasons aside) it is <em>impossible</em>
that those pills can have been my pills. God hears me say it,
and knows that it is true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Old Jones, balancing the keys in his hand, was standing within the
room, listening. Abel Crew was so respectable and courteous a prisoner,
compared with those he generally had in the lock-up, burglars, tipsy
men, and the like, returning him a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; instead of an oath,
that he had already begun to regard him with some favour, and the
assertion seemed to make an impression on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Whose pills could they have been, if they
warn&rsquo;t yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot imagine,&rdquo; returned Abel Crew. &ldquo;I am as curious about
it as any one else&mdash;Master Ludlow here knows I am. I dare say it
will come out sometime. They <em>could not</em> have been made up by me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that you told the coroner about your pill-boxes being
marked?&rdquo; asked old Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so they are marked; all of them. The pill-box I saw
there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean the stock o&rsquo; boxes you&rsquo;ve got at home. Be they all
marked?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every one of them. When I have in a fresh lot of pill-boxes the
first thing I do, on bringing them home, is to mark them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then look here. You just trust me with the key of your place,
and tell me where the boxes are to be found, and I&rsquo;ll go and secure
&rsquo;em, and lay &rsquo;em afore the coroner. If they be all found marked, it&rsquo;ll
tell in your favour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The advice sounded good, and Abel Crew handed over his key.
Jones looked solemn as he and I went away together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an odd thing, though, Master Johnny, ain&rsquo;t it, how the pison
could ha&rsquo; got into them there pills,&rdquo; said he slowly, as he put the big
key into the lock of the outer door.</p>

<p>And we had an audience round us before the words were well
spoken. To see the lock-up made fast when there was a prisoner
within it, was always a coveted recreation in Piefinch Cut. Several
individuals had come running up; not to speak of children from the
gutters. Dovey stood gazing in front of his forge; Figg, who liked
to be lounging about outside when he had no customers transacting
delicate negotiations within, backed against his shop-window, and stared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
in concert with Dovey. Jones flourishing the formidable keys, crossed
over to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do he feel to-day?&rdquo; asked Figg, nodding towards the lock-up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t feel no worse appariently than he do other days,&rdquo; replied
old Jones. &ldquo;It be a regular odd thing, it be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What be odd?&rdquo; asked Dovey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How the pison could ha&rsquo; got into them there pills. Crew says he
has never had no pison in his place o&rsquo; no kind, herbs nor else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I would pledge my word that it is the truth,&rdquo; I put in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and so I think it is,&rdquo; said Dovey. &ldquo;Last night George Reed
was in here a-talking. He says he one day come across Abel Crew
looking for herbs in the copse behind the Grange. Crew was picking
and choosing: some herbs he&rsquo;d leave alone, and some he dug up.
Reed spied out a fine-looking plant, and called to him. Up comes
Crew, trowel in hand, bends down to take a look, and then gives his
head a shake. &lsquo;That won&rsquo;t do for me,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;that plant has
poisonous properties,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;and I never meddles with them that
has,&rsquo; says he. George Reed told us that much in this here forge last
night. Him and his wife have a&rsquo;most had words about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had words about what?&rdquo; asked old Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, about them pills. Reed tells her that if it is the pills what
poisoned the young ones, she have made some mull o&rsquo; the box Abel
give her and got it changed. But he don&rsquo;t believe as &rsquo;twere the pills
at all. And Hester Reed, she sticks to it that she never made no mull
o&rsquo; the box, and that the pills is the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this juncture, happening to turn my head, I saw Mrs. Dovey at
the door at the back of the forge, her face screwed round the doorpost,
listening: and there was a great fear on it. Seeing me looking at her,
she disappeared like a shot, and quietly closed the door. A thought
flashed across me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That woman knows more about it than she will say! And it is
frightening her. What can the mystery be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children were buried on the Sunday afternoon, all the parish
flocking to the funeral; and the next morning Abel Crew was released.
Whether old Jones had become doubtful as to the legality of what he
had done, or whether he received a mandate from the coroner by the
early post, no one knew. Certain it was, that before nine o&rsquo;clock old
Jones held the lock-up doors open, and Abel Crew walked out. It
was thought that some one must have written privately to the coroner&mdash;which
was more than likely. Old Jones was down in the mouth all
day, as if he had had an official blowing-up.</p>

<p>Abel and his stick went home. The rest and his own doctoring had
very nearly cured the instep. On the Saturday old Jones had made a
descent upon the cottage and cleared it of the pill-boxes. Jones found
that every box had Abel&rsquo;s private mark upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is a curious start, Crew!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Duffham,
meeting him as he was turning in at his gate. &ldquo;Now in the lock-up,
and now out of it! It may be old Jones&rsquo;s notion of law, but it is not
mine. How have you enjoyed it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would not have been so bad but for the rats, sir,&rdquo; replied Abel.
&ldquo;I could see a few stars shining through the skylight.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>The days went on to the Thursday, and it was now the evening before
the adjourned inquest. Tod and I, in consideration of the popular
ferment, had taken the Squire at a favourable moment, and extracted
from him another week&rsquo;s holiday. Opinions were divided: some
believed in Crew, others in the poisoned pills. As to Crew himself, he
was out in his garden as usual, attending to his bees, and his herbs and
flowers, and quietly awaiting the good or the ill luck that Fate might
have in store for him.</p>

<p>It was Thursday evening, I say; and I was taking tea with Duffham.
Having looked in upon him, when rushing about the place, he asked me to
stay. The conversation turned upon the all-engrossing topic; and I
chanced to mention that the behaviour of Ann Dovey puzzled me.
Upon that, Duffham said that it was puzzling him. He had been
called in to her the previous day, and found her in a regular fever,
eyes anxious, breath hysterical, face hectic. Since the day of the
inquest she had been more or less in this state, and the blacksmith
told Duffham he could not make out what had come to her. &ldquo;Them
pills have drove her mad, sir,&rdquo; were Dovey&rsquo;s words; &ldquo;she can&rsquo;t get
&rsquo;em off her mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last cup of tea was poured out, and Duffham was shaking round
the old black pot to see if he could squeeze out any more, when we
received an interruption. Dovey came bursting in upon us straight
from his forge; his black hair ruffled, his small dark face hot with
flurry. It was a singular tale he had come to tell. His wife had been
making a confession to him. Driven pretty nearly out of her mind by
the weight of a secret, she could hold it no longer.</p>

<p>To begin at the beginning. Dovey&rsquo;s house swarmed with black-beetles.
Dovey himself did not mind the animals, but Mrs. Dovey
did; and no wonder, when she could not step out of bed in the night
without putting her foot on one. But, if Dovey did not dislike black-beetles,
there was another thing he did dislike&mdash;hated in fact; and
that was the stuff called beetle-powder: which professed to kill them.
Mrs. Dovey would have scattered some on the floor every night; but
Dovey would not allow it. He forbid her to bring a grain of it into the
house: it was nothing but poison, he said, and might chance to kill
themselves as well as the beetles. Ann Dovey had her way in most
matters, for Dovey was easy, as men and husbands go; but when once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
he put his veto on a thing, she knew she might as well try to turn the
house round as turn him.</p>

<p>Now what did Ann Dovey do? On that very Easter Tuesday, as it
chanced, as soon as dusk had set in, off she went to Dame Chad&rsquo;s
general shop in Church Dykely, where the beetle-power was sold, and
bought a packet of it. It seemed to her, that of the choice between
two evils&mdash;to put up with the horrible black animals, or to disobey Dovey,
the latter was the more agreeable. She could easily shake some of
the powder down lightly of a night; the beetles would eat it up before
morning, and Dovey would never know it. Accordingly, paying for
the powder&mdash;a square packet, done up in blue paper, on which was
labelled &ldquo;Poison&rdquo; in as large letters as the printer could get into the
space&mdash;she thrust it into the depths of her gown-pocket&mdash;it was her
holiday gown&mdash;and set off home again. Calling in at George Reed&rsquo;s
cottage on her way, she there assisted, as it also chanced, in administering
the pills to the unfortunate children. And perhaps her motive for
calling in was not so much from a love of presiding at physic-giving,
as that she might be able, when she got home, to say &ldquo;At Reed&rsquo;s,&rdquo; if
her husband asked her where she had been. It fell out as she thought.
No sooner had she put foot inside the forge than Dovey began,
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;st been, Ann?&rdquo; and she told him at Reed&rsquo;s, helping with the
sick little ones. Dovey&rsquo;s work was over for the night; he wanted his
supper; and she had no opportunity of using the beetle-powder. It
was left untouched in the pocket of her gown. The following morning
came the astounding news of the children&rsquo;s death; and in the excitement
caused by that, Mrs. Dovey lost sight of the powder. Perhaps
she thought that the general stir might cause Dovey to be more
wakeful than usual, and that she might as well let the powder be for a
short time. It was safe where it was, in her hung-up gown. Dovey
never meddled with her pockets: on or off, they were no concern of
his.</p>

<p>But, on the Friday morning, when putting on this same holiday
gown to attend the inquest, to which she had been summoned, what
was her horror to find the packet burst, and her pocket filled with the
loose powder. Mrs. Dovey had no greater love for beetle-powder in
itself than she had for beetles, and visibly shuddered. She could not
empty it out; there it had to remain; for Dovey, excited by his wife&rsquo;s
having to give evidence, was in and out of her room like a dog in a
fair; and she went off perforce with the stuff in her pocket. And
when during her examination the questions took the turn they did
take, and the coroner asked her whether she had had any poison in her
pocket that night at George Reed&rsquo;s; this, with the consciousness of
what had been that night in her pocket, of what was in her pocket at
that very moment, then present, nearly frightened her into fits. From
that hour, Ann Dovey had lived in a state of terror. It was not that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
she believed any of the beetle-powder <em>could</em> have got inside the ill-fated
young ones (though she did not feel quite easy on the point), as that
she feared the accusation might be shifted off Crew&rsquo;s shoulders and on
to hers. On this Thursday evening she could hold out no longer; and
disclosed all to Dovey.</p>

<p>Dovey burst upon us in a heat. He was as straightforward a man
as ever lived, of an intensely honest nature, and could no more have
kept it in, now that he knew it, than he could have given up all
righteous dealing together. His chief concern was to tell the truth,
and to restore peace to his wife. He went through the narrative to
Duffham without stopping; and seemed not in the least to care for my
being present.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t <em>possible</em>, sir, there ain&rsquo;t a moral <em>possibility</em> that any o&rsquo; that
there dratted powder could have come anigh the babies,&rdquo; wound up
Dovey. &ldquo;I should be thankful, sir, if you&rsquo;d come down and quieten
her a bit; her be in a fine way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What with surprise, and what with the man&rsquo;s rapid speech, Duffham
had not taken in one-half of the tale. He had simply sat behind the
teapot and stared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good fellow, I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A pocketful of
poison! What on earth made her take poison to George Reed&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Dovey went over the heads of the story again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas in her pocket, sir, our Ann&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s true; but the chances are
that at that time the paper hadn&rsquo;t burst. None of it <em>couldn&rsquo;t</em> ha&rsquo; got
to them there two young ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To see the blacksmith&rsquo;s earnestness was good. His face was as
eager, his tone as imploring, as though he were pleading for his life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it &rsquo;ud be a work of charity, sir, if you&rsquo;d just step down and
see her. I&rsquo;d pay handsome for the visit, sir; anything you please to
charge. She&rsquo;s like one going right out of her mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; said Duffham, who had his curiosity upon the point.</p>

<p>And the blacksmith set off on the run home again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this is a curious thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Duffham, when he had
gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could the beetle-powder have poisoned the children?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Johnny. It is an odd tale altogether. We will go
down and inquire into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which of course implied that he expected me to go with him.
Nothing loath was I; more eager than he.</p>

<p>Finishing what was left of the tea and bread-and-butter, we went on
to Piefinch Cut. Ann Dovey was alone, except for her husband and
mother. She flung herself on the sofa when she saw us&mdash;the blacksmith&rsquo;s
house was comfortably off for furniture&mdash;and began to scream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, just you stop that, Ann Dovey,&rdquo; said Duffham, who was
always short with hysterics. &ldquo;I want to come to the bottom of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
business; you can&rsquo;t tell it me while you scream. What in the world
possessed you to go about with your pocket full of poison?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had her share of sense, and knew Duffham was not one to be
trifled with; so she told the tale as well as she could for sobbing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you mentioned this out of doors?&rdquo; was the first question
Duffham asked when it was over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; interposed Dovey. &ldquo;I telled &rsquo;er afore I come to you not to
be soft enough for that. Not a soul have heard it, sir, but me and
her&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to the old mother&mdash;&ldquo;and you and Master Johnny.
We don&rsquo;t want all the parish swarming about us like so many hornets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Duffham. &ldquo;But it is rather a serious thing, I fear.
Uncertain, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be it, sir?&rdquo; returned Ann, raising her heavy eyes questioningly.
&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, the mischief must have lain between that beetle-powder
and Crew&rsquo;s pills. As Crew is so careful a man, I don&rsquo;t think it
could have been the pills; and that&rsquo;s the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how could the beetle-powder have got anigh the children out
of my pocket, sir?&rdquo; she asked, her eyes wild. &ldquo;I never put my hand
into my pocket while I sat there; I never did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be sure of that,&rdquo; returned Duffham. &ldquo;We may put our
hands into our pockets fifty times a day without remembering it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you suppose, sir, I should take out some o&rsquo; that there beetle-powder
and cram it down the poor innocents&rsquo; throats?&rdquo; she demanded,
on the verge of further screaming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the powder?&rdquo; questioned Duffham.</p>

<p>The powder was where it had been all along: in the gown-pocket.
Want of opportunity, through fear of Dovey&rsquo;s eyes, or dread of
touching the stuff, had kept her from meddling with it. When she
took the gown off, the night of the inquest, she hung it up on the
accustomed hook, and there it was still. The old mother went to the
bedroom and brought it forward, handling it gingerly: a very smart
print gown with bright flowers upon it.</p>

<p>Duffham looked round, saw a tin pie-dish, and turned the pocket
inside out into it. A speckled sort of powder, brown and white. He
plunged his fingers into it fearlessly, felt it, and smelt it. The blue
paper it had been sold in lay amidst it, cracked all across. Duffham
took it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poison!&rdquo; read out he aloud, gazing at the large letters through his
spectacles. &ldquo;How came you to let it break open in your pocket, Ann
Dovey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t let it; it braked of itself,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;If you saw the
black-beedles we gets here of a night, sir, you&rsquo;d be fit to dance a hornpipe,
you would. The floor be covered with &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the ceiling was covered with &rsquo;em too, I wouldn&rsquo;t have that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
there dangerous stuff brought into the place&mdash;and so I&rsquo;ve telled ye
often,&rdquo; roared Dovey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s frightful uncomfortable, is black-beedles; mother knows it,&rdquo;
said his wife, in a subdued voice&mdash;for Dovey in great things was master.
&ldquo;I thought if I just sprinkled a bit on&rsquo;t down, it &rsquo;ud take &rsquo;em away,
and couldn&rsquo;t hurt nobody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you went off on the sly that there Tuesday night and bought
it,&rdquo; he retorted; &ldquo;and come back and telled me you had been to Reed&rsquo;s
helping to physic the babies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so I had been there, helping to physic &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you go straight to Reed&rsquo;s from the shop&mdash;with this powder?&rdquo;
asked Duffham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was right at the bottom o&rsquo; my pocket: I put it there as soon as
Dame Chad had served me with it,&rdquo; sobbed Ann Dovey. &ldquo;And I
can be upon my Bible oath, Dr. Duffham, that I never touched it
after; and I don&rsquo;t believe it had then burst. A-coming hasty out of
Reed&rsquo;s back-gate, for I were in a hurry to get home, the pocket swung
again&rsquo; the post, and I think the blue paper must ha&rsquo; burst then. I
never knowed it had burst, for I&rsquo;d never thought no more about the
beedles till I put on the gownd to go up to the inquest. Master Johnny,
you be a-staring at me fearful, but I&rsquo;m telling nothing but the naked
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did seem to be telling the truth. And as to my &ldquo;staring at her
fearful,&rdquo; that was just her imagination. I was listening to the talk
from the elbow of the wooden chair, on which I had perched
myself. Duffham recommended Dovey to put the tin dish and its
contents away safely, so that it did not get near any food, but not to
destroy the stuff just yet. He talked a bit with Ann, left her a composing
draught, and came away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that the powder could have had anything to do with the
children&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; I said to him as we went along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither do I, Johnny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall you have to declare this at the inquest to-morrow, Mr.
Duffham?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered, looking up at the sky
through his spectacles, just as a perplexed owl might do. &ldquo;It might
only serve to complicate matters: and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible it
could have been the powder. On the other hand, if it be proved not to
have been the pills, we have only this poisonous powder to fall back
upon. It is a strange affair altogether, take it in all its bearings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not answer. The evening star was beginning to show itself in
the sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must feel my way in this, Johnny: be guided by circumstances,&rdquo;
he resumed, when we halted at the stile that led across the fields to
the Manor. &ldquo;We must watch the turn matters take to-morrow at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
inquest. Of course if I find it necessary to declare it, I shall declare it.
Meanwhile, lad, you had better not mention it to any one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Mr. Duffham. Good-evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The jury went straggling into the Silver Bear by twos and threes.
Up dashed the coroner&rsquo;s gig, as before, he and his clerk seated side by
side. All the parish had collected about the doors, and were trying to
push into the inquest-room.</p>

<p>Gliding quietly in, before the proceedings were opened, came Abel
Crew in his quaint velvet suit, his silver hair gleaming in the sunlight,
his pale face calm as marble. The coroner ordered him to sit on a
certain chair, and whispered to old Jones. Upon which the constable
turned his gouty legs round, marched up, and stood guard over Crew,
just as though Abel were his prisoner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see that, sir?&rdquo; I whispered to Duffham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, lad, and understand it. Crew&rsquo;s pills have been analyzed&mdash;officially
this time, as the jury put it&mdash;and found to contain arsenic.
Pettipher was right. The pills killed the children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, you might have knocked me down with a feather. I had been
fully trusting in Crew&rsquo;s innocence.</p>

<p>About the first witness called, and sworn, was the professional man
from a distance who had analyzed the pills. He said that they contained
arsenic. Not in sufficient quantity to hurt a grown-up person;
more than sufficient to kill a little child. The coroner drew in his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it must be so,&rdquo; he said, apparently for the benefit of the
jury. &ldquo;Am I to understand that these were improper pills to send
out?&mdash;pills that no medical man would be likely to send?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not improper at all, sir,&rdquo; replied the witness. &ldquo;A medical man
would prescribe them for certain cases. Not for children: to an infant
one would be what it has been here&mdash;destruction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt a nudge at my elbow, and turned to see the Squire&rsquo;s hot face
close to mine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny, don&rsquo;t you ever stand up for that Crew again. He ought
to be hanged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the coroner, after a bit, seemed puzzled; or rather, doubtful.
Led to be so, perhaps, by a question put by one of the jury. It was
Perkins the butcher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If these pills were furnished by Abel Crew for Hester Reed, a
growed woman, and she went and gave one of her own accord to the
two babies, ought Crew to be held responsible for that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon which there ensued some cavilling. Some of the jury holding
that he was <em>not</em> responsible; others that he was. The coroner reminded
them of what Hester Reed had stated in her evidence&mdash;that
she had asked Crew&rsquo;s opinion about the suitability of the pills for
children, and he had told her they were suitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Hester Reed was called. As the throng parted to make way for her
to advance, I saw Ann Dovey seated at the back of the room, looking
more dead than alive. Dovey stood by her, having made himself
spruce for the occasion. Ann would have gone off a mile in some
opposite direction, but old Jones&rsquo;s orders to all the witnesses of the
former day, to appear again, had been peremptory. They had been
wanted before, he told them, and might be wanted again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not look such a scarecrow with fright,&rdquo; I whispered in
Ann Dovey&rsquo;s ear, making my way to her side to reassure her, the
woman was so evidently miserable. &ldquo;It was the pills that did the
mischief, after all&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you hear? Nothing need come out about
your pocket and the powder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Johnny, I&rsquo;m just about skeered out o&rsquo; my life, I am. Fit
to go and drown myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! It will be all right as far as you are concerned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said it was Crew&rsquo;s pills, all along, I did; it couldn&rsquo;t have been
anything else, sir. All the same, I wish I was dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As good try to console a post, seemingly, as Ann Dovey. I went
back to my standing-place between the Squire and Duffham. Hester
Reed was being questioned then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, it were some weeks ago. My little boy was ailing, and I
ran out o&rsquo; the house to Abel Crew, seeing the old gentleman go past
the gate, and asked whether I might give him one of them there same
pills, or whether it would hurt the child. Crew said I might give it
freely; he said two even wouldn&rsquo;t hurt him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did you give the pill?&rdquo; asked the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. He&rsquo;s a rare bad one to give physic to, Gregory is, and I
let him get well without it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How old is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turned of three, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are absolutely certain, Mrs. Reed, that these pills, from which
you took out two to give the deceased children, were the very self-same
pills you had from Abel Crew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I be sure and certain of it, sir. Nobody never put a finger upon
the box but me. It stood all the while in the corner o&rsquo; the press-shelf
in the children&rsquo;s bedroom. Twice a week when I got upon a
chair to dust the shelf, I see it there. There was nobody in the house
but me, except the little ones. My husband don&rsquo;t concern himself
with the places and things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Circumstantial evidence could not well go farther. Mrs. Reed was
dismissed, and the coroner told Abel Crew to come near the table. He
did as he was bid, and stood there upright and manly, a gentle look on
his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have heard the evidence, Abel Crew,&rdquo; said the coroner.
&ldquo;The pills have been analyzed and found to contain a certain portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of arsenic&mdash;a great deal more than enough to kill a child. What have
you to say to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only this, sir; only what I said before. That the pills analyzed
were not my pills. The pills I gave to Mrs. Reed contained neither
arsenic nor any other poison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is showing great obstinacy on your part to repeat that,&rdquo; returned
the coroner, impatiently. &ldquo;Mrs. Reed swears that the pills were the
same pills; and she evidently speaks the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure she thinks she speaks it,&rdquo; replied Abel, gently.
&ldquo;Nevertheless, sir, I assure you she is mistaken. In some way the
pills must have been changed whilst in her possession, box and all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, man, in what manner do you suppose they could have been
changed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. All I do know is, that the pills and the box
produced here last week were not, either of them, the pills and the
box she had from me. Never a box went out from me, sir, but had
my private mark on it&mdash;the mark I spoke of. Jones the constable
searched my place whilst I was detained in the lock-up, and took away
all the pill-boxes out of it. Let him testify whether he found one
without the mark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this juncture a whole cargo of pill-boxes were shot out of a bag
on the table by old Jones, some empty, some filled with pills. The
coroner and jury began to examine them, and found the mark on all,
lids and boxes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you&rsquo;d be so good as to cause the pills to be analyzed, sir,
they would be found perfectly free from poison,&rdquo; resumed Abel.
&ldquo;They are made from herbs that possess healing properties, not
irritant; a poisonous herb, whether poisonous in itself, or one from
which poison may be extracted, I never plucked. Believe me, sir, for
I am telling the truth; the truth before Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The coroner said nothing for a minute or two: I think the words
impressed him. He began lifting the lid again from one or two of the
boxes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are these pills for? All for the same disorder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were made up for different disorders, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And pray how do you distinguish them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot distinguish them now. They have been mixed. Even
if returned to me I could not use them. I have a piece of furniture at
home, sir, that I call my pill-case. It has various drawers in it, each
drawer being labelled with the sort of pills kept in it: camomile,
dandelion, and so on. Mr. Jones must be able to corroborate this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Old Jones nodded. He had never seen nothing neater nor more
exact in all his life, than the keeping o&rsquo; them there pills. He, Mr.
Jones, had tumbled the drawerfuls indiscriminately into his bag, and
so mixed them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And they will be so much loss to me,&rdquo; quietly observed Abel. &ldquo;It
does not matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you brought up to the medical profession?&rdquo; cried the
coroner&mdash;and some of us thought he put the question in irony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Abel, taking it seriously. &ldquo;I have learnt the
healing art, as supplied by herbs and roots, and I know their value.
Herbs will cure sometimes where the regular doctor fails. I have
myself cured cases with them that the surgeons could not cure; cases
that but for me, under God, might never have been cured in this
world. I make no boast of it; any one else might do as much who
had made herbs a study as I have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you making a fortune by it?&rdquo; went on the coroner.</p>

<p>Abel shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a small income of my own, sir, and it is enough for my
simple wants. What little money I make by my medicines, and honey,
and that&mdash;it is not much&mdash;I find uses for in other ways. I indulge in
a new book now and then; and there are many poor people around
who need a bit of help sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You &lsquo;read&rsquo; the stars, I am told, Abel Crew. What do you read
in them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same that I read, sir, in all other of nature&rsquo;s works: God&rsquo;s
wonderful hand. His wisdom, His power, His providence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps the coroner thought to bring Abel to ridicule in his replies:
if so, it was a mistake, for he seemed to be getting the worst of it
himself. At any rate, he quitted the subject abruptly, brushed his
energy up, and began talking to the jury.</p>

<p>The drift of the conversation was, so far as the room could hear it,
that Crew&rsquo;s pills, and only Crew&rsquo;s, could have been the authors of the
mischief to the two deceased children, whose bodies they were sitting
upon, and that Crew must be committed to take his trial for manslaughter.
&ldquo;Hester Reed&rsquo;s evidence,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is so clear and
positive, that it quite puts aside any suspicion of the box of pills having
been changed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The box had not my mark upon it, sir,&rdquo; respectfully spoke Abel
Crew, his tone anxious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me,&rdquo; rebuked the coroner, sharply. &ldquo;As to the
box not having what he calls his private mark upon it,&rdquo; he added to
the jury, &ldquo;that in my opinion tells little. Because a man has put a
mark on fifty pill-boxes, he is not obliged to have put it on the fifty-first.
An unintentional omission is readily made. It appears to
me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I in time? Is it all over? Is Abel Crew found guilty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This unceremonious interruption to the official speech came from a
woman&rsquo;s voice. The door of the room was thrown open with a fling,
considerably discomposing those who had their backs against it and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
were taken unawares, and they were pushed right and left by the
struggles of some one to get to the front. The coroner looked daggers;
old Jones lifted his staff; but the intruder forced her way forward with
resolute equanimity. Cathy Reed: we never remembered to call her
Parrifer. Cathy in her Sunday-going gown and a pink bonnet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you?&rdquo; cried the coroner. &ldquo;What do you mean by
this? Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come rushing over from Tewkesbury to clear Abel Crew,&rdquo;
returned Cathy, recovering her breath after the fight. &ldquo;The pills that
killed the children were my pills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The commotion this avowal caused in the room was beyond
describing. The coroner stared, the jury all turned to look at the
speaker, the crowd trod upon one another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And sorry to my heart I am that it should have been so,&rdquo; went on
Cathy. &ldquo;I loved those two dear little ones as if they were my own,
and I&rsquo;d rather my pills had killed myself. Just look at that, please,
Mr. Coroner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ease with which Cathy spoke to the official gentleman, the
coolness with which she put down a pill-box on the green cloth before
him, took the room by surprise. As Ann Dovey remarked, later,
&ldquo;She must ha&rsquo; learnt that there manner in her travels with young
Parrifer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; questioned the coroner, curtly, picking up the box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll ask Mr. Crew whether he knows it, sir, before I say
what it is,&rdquo; returned Cathy.</p>

<p>The coroner had opened it. It contained seven pills; just the size
of the other pills, and looking exactly like them. On the lid and on
the box was the private mark spoken of by Abel Crew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is my box, sir; and these&mdash;I am certain of it&mdash;are my pills,&rdquo;
spoke Abel, earnestly, bending over the shoulder of the first juryman
to look into the box. &ldquo;The box and the pills that I gave to Mrs.
Reed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so they are, Abel Crew,&rdquo; rejoined Cathy, emphatically. &ldquo;The
week before last, which I was spending at home at father&rsquo;s, I changed
the one pill-box for the other, inadvertent, you see&rdquo;&mdash;with a nod to
the coroner&mdash;&ldquo;and took the wrong box away with me. And I wish
both boxes had been in the sea before I&rsquo;d done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cathy was ordered to give her account more clearly, and did so.
She had been suffering from illness, accompanied by neuralgia, and a
doctor at Tewkesbury had prescribed some pills for it, one to be taken
occasionally. The chemist who made them up told her they contained
arsenic. He was about to write the directions on the box, when Cathy,
who was in a hurry, snatched it from him, saying she could not wait
for that bother, flung down the money, and departed. This box of
pills she had brought with her on her visit to her father&rsquo;s, lest she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
should find occasion to take one; and she had put it on the shelf of the
press, side by side with the other pill-box, to be out of the way of the
children. Upon leaving, she took up the wrong box inadvertently:
carrying away Abel Crew&rsquo;s pills, leaving her own. There lay the explanation
of the mystery of the fatal mistake. Mrs. Reed had not
known that Cathy had any pills with her; the girl, who was just as
light-headed as ever, not having chanced to mention it; and Cathy had
the grace to dust the room herself whilst she was there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When father and his wife sent me word about the death of the two
little twins, and that it was some pills of Abel Crew&rsquo;s that had done it,
I never once thought o&rsquo; my pills,&rdquo; added Cathy. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t as
much as come into my head. But late last night I got lent to me last
Saturday&rsquo;s <cite>Worcester Herald</cite>, and there I read the inquest, and what
Crew had said about the marks he put on his pill-boxes, and mother&rsquo;s
evidence about never having shifted the pill-box from its place on the
press. &lsquo;Sure and I couldn&rsquo;t have changed the boxes,&rsquo; thought I to
myself; and upstairs I ran in a fright to look at the box I had brought
away. Yes, there it was&mdash;Abel Crew&rsquo;s box with the marks on it; and
I knew then that I had left my own pills at home here, and that they
had killed the babies. As soon as I could get away this morning&mdash;which
was not as soon as I wanted to&mdash;I started to come over. And
that&rsquo;s the history&mdash;and the blessed truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course it was the truth. Abel&rsquo;s beautiful face had a glow upon
it. &ldquo;I knew I should be cleared in God&rsquo;s good time,&rdquo; he breathed.
The Squire pounced upon him, and shook both his hands as if he would
never let them go again. Duffham held out his.</p>

<p>So that was the end of the story. Cathy was reprimanded by the
coroner for her carelessness, and burst into tears in his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And thee come off home wi&rsquo; thee, and see me chuck that there
powder into the fire; and don&rsquo;t go making a spectacle o&rsquo; th&rsquo; self again,&rdquo;
cried Dovey, sharply, in his wife&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;Thee just let me catch thee
bringing in more o&rsquo; the dratted stuff; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall never look at a black-beedle again, Jack, without shivering,&rdquo;
she answered; going in for a slight instalment of shivering there and
then. &ldquo;It might ha&rsquo; come to hanging. Leastways, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve
been dreaming of.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><span class="f9">V.</span><br />

ROBERT ASHTON&rsquo;S WEDDING-DAY.</h2>


<p>The hall-clock was striking half-past five as we went out into the sharp
night-air: Mr. and Mrs. Todhetley, I, and Tod. We were spending
Christmas that year at Crabb Cot. Old Coney&rsquo;s dinner was fixed for
six: but country people don&rsquo;t observe the fashion of dashing in at the
last stroke of the hour. The weather was cold, and no mistake; the
snow lay on the ground; the stars shone like silver. This was Tuesday,
New Year&rsquo;s Day; and to-morrow, the second of January, Jane Coney
would be married to Robert Ashton of Timberdale. The Ashtons were
to dine to-night at the Farm, and we had been asked to meet them.
If every one stood upon his own level, we should shoot up some degrees
over the Coneys&rsquo; heads in the scale of the world&rsquo;s ladder; for old
Coney was only a plain farmer; and you&rsquo;ve learnt by this time what
the Squire was. But the Coneys were right-down good people, and
made the best neighbours in the world.</p>

<p>We had only to cross the road slantwise, and old Coney had had it
swept for us. It was an old-fashioned farm-house, full of nooks and
angles, with one ugly, big room in it, oak-panelled. The cloth was
laid there for to-night, the breakfast would be for the morrow. Old
Coney and Mrs. Coney came out of the drawing-room to meet us:
that was small and snug, with a running pattern of pale roses on its
white-watered walls. He was jolly; she, plain, homely, and sensible.</p>

<p>Jane was quiet, like her mother; very well she looked, standing on
the carpet in her pretty blue silk dress. Her brother Tom, a tall,
strong young fellow with a red face, lifted her out of the way by the
waist, that he might shake hands all round. The eldest daughter,
Mary West, was staying there with her nurse and baby; she looked
ill, and got up only for a minute from her chair by the fire. Her
husband was a lawyer, in practice at Worcester. Another young lady
was sitting near, with light frizzed hair: Mrs. James Ashton.</p>

<p>Before we had settled down, wheels were heard. It was Robert
Ashton&rsquo;s dog-cart, bringing his two brothers, Charles and James; and
Mary West&rsquo;s husband. Miss Jane&rsquo;s cheeks turned as red as a rose for
nothing: Robert Ashton had not come with them.</p>

<p>I had better say who the Ashtons were. Old Ashton (the father)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
had lived at Timberdale Court always. It was one of the best farms
in all Worcestershire. Old Ashton lived in good style, educated his
children, and started them well in life. Lucy, the only girl, married a
Captain Bird, who turned out to be a frightful scamp. Robert remained
on the farm with his father; Charles was a clergyman; James a doctor
in Worcester. Everybody respected Mr. Ashton. It was about three
years now since he died, and he left a good pot of money behind him.
Robert succeeded to the farm, and it was he who was to marry Jane
Coney to-morrow.</p>

<p>They went upstairs with their carpet-bags, having come direct from
Worcester by train; Robert Ashton&rsquo;s dog-cart had been waiting, as
arranged, at Timberdale Station to bring them on. Mrs. James Ashton
came over earlier in the day with Mrs. West. Robert and Charles
Ashton were both fine young men, but the doctor was slight and short.
Now I hope all that&rsquo;s clear; because it was necessary to say it.</p>

<p>What with talking and looking at the presents, the time passed.
They were laid out on a table against the wall, on a snow-white
damask cloth of rare beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Coney, taking up a scented blue-and-white
case of satin ribbon and beads for holding pocket-handkerchiefs.
&ldquo;Poor Lucy Bird sent this. She must have made it herself, a thing
like this, bought, would be as much as fifteen or sixteen shillings. It
came almost anonymously: &lsquo;With best love and ever kind wishes for
Robert and Jane,&rsquo; written on it; but we knew Lucy&rsquo;s handwriting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are they now?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Todhetley, in the same
mysterious whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancy they are staying somewhere in Worcester. We should
have liked to have Lucy over for the wedding; but&mdash;you know how it
is: we could not ask him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Todhetley nodded. She wore her grey silk gown that night,
which always seemed to make her look taller and thinner than ever,
and a white lace cap with pink ribbons. A pink bow was in her light
hair, and she had put on her beautiful earrings.</p>

<p>There is some thorn in most families, and Lucy was the one in that
of Ashton. She was educated at the best school in Worcester, and
came home at eighteen brimful of romance. It lay in her nature.
You&rsquo;d hardly have found so pretty and sentimental a girl in the county.
Because her name was Lucy Ashton, she identified herself with Scott&rsquo;s
Lucy Ashton, and looked out for a Master of Ravenswood. These
sentimental girls sometimes come to grief, for they possess only three
parts of their share of plain common-sense. The Master of Ravenswood
came in the shape of Captain Bird, a tall, dark man, with a
flaming coat and fierce moustache. He paid court to Lucy, and she
fell in love with him before a week was over. The Ashtons turned
their backs upon him: there was something in the man they did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
like, in spite of the red coat and the black moustache. But he won
Lucy over&mdash;he had heard of her fortune, you see&mdash;and she promised
to marry him. She was a gentle, yielding, timid girl then; but her
love was strong, and she ran away. She ran away and was married
the same morning at St. Helen&rsquo;s church in Worcester, in which parish
Bird had been staying. It was the talk of the county; but when the
commotion had subsided, every one began to pity Lucy, saying she
would have plenty of time and cause for repentance. After all, he
was not a real captain now. He had sold out of the army; and there
arose a rumour that he had done something wrong and was obliged to
sell out.</p>

<p>Mr. Ashton had loved Lucy better than all his children. He
forgave the marriage for Lucy&rsquo;s sake, and had them home on a visit,
and presented her with a handsome sum. But he made a great
mistake&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heard the Squire say it often&mdash;in not settling it upon
her. Bird spent it as soon as he well could; and he would have spent
some more that came to Lucy when her father died, only that it was
left in Robert Ashton&rsquo;s hands to be paid to her quarterly. People
called Bird a blackleg: said he was about the worst man that ever
stepped. Robert had offered Lucy a home at Timberdale Court, but
she would not leave her husband: she had married him, she said, for
better or worse. If he came to be transported&mdash;and he was going on
for it&mdash;the chances were that Lucy would follow him to Van Diemen&rsquo;s
Land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, there&rsquo;s six o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Coney, as the hour
struck. &ldquo;Jane, what have you done with Robert?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not anything, papa. He said he should be here half-an-hour
before dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it will soon be half-an-hour after it,&rdquo; returned old Coney.
&ldquo;If he does not make haste, we shall sit down without him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clock on the mantelpiece went ticking on, and struck half-past
six. Dinner. The Squire led off the van with Mrs. Coney. Tod laid
hold of Jane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take Robert&rsquo;s place whilst I can, Jenny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The oak-room was a surprise. It looked beautiful. The dark walls
were quite covered with holly and ivy, mixed with the blossoms of
laurustinus and some bright flowers. Old Thomas (borrowed from us)
and the maids stood by the sideboard, which glittered with silver. The
Coneys had their stores as well as other people, and did things well
when they did them at all. On the table was a large codfish, garnished
with horse-radish and lemon. Our names were before our places, and
we took them without bustle, Robert Ashton&rsquo;s, next to Jane, being left
vacant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For what&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A faint shriek interrupted the Reverend Mr. Ashton, and the grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
was interrupted. Lifting his head towards the quarter whence the
shriek came, he saw his sister-in-law with a scared face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are thirteen!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. James Ashton. &ldquo;I beg your
pardon, Charles&mdash;I beg everybody&rsquo;s pardon; but indeed we must not sit
down thirteen to dinner on New Year&rsquo;s Day. I would not for any money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What nonsense, my dear!&rdquo; cried her husband, rather crossly.
&ldquo;Robert will be here directly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was of no use. The ladies took her part, saying they ought not
to sit down. And there we all stood, uncertain what to do, the dinner
hovering in mid-air like Mahomet&rsquo;s coffin, and not to be eaten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are two days in the year when it is not well to sit down
thirteen: New Year&rsquo;s Day and Christmas Day,&rdquo; said Mrs. Todhetley,
and the rest held with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we all to go back to the drawing-room, and leave our dinner?&rdquo;
demanded old Coney, in wrath. &ldquo;Where the plague <em>is</em> Robert?
Look here: those that won&rsquo;t sit down thirteen can go, and those that
don&rsquo;t mind it can stop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; cried the Squire.</p>

<p>But Jane Coney went gliding to her mother&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;I will wait for
Robert in the drawing-room, mamma, and you can sit down twelve. Yes,
please; it is best so. Indeed I could not eat anything if I stayed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we send you some dinner in, child?&rdquo; asked Mr. Coney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, papa. I should like best to take it with Robert
when he comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said old Coney. &ldquo;Johnny, you go over to that side, to
make the table even. We&rsquo;ll have the grace now, parson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the parson said it.</p>

<p>It was a dinner that pleased the Squire&rsquo;s heart. He had a mortal
objection to what he called kickshaws, meaning the superfluous dishes
you find at a modern entertainment. The Coneys never had kickshaws,
only a plain, substantial dinner, the best of its kind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coney, I never taste such oyster-sauce as yours, go where I will,&rdquo;
cried the Squire. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be matched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Old Coney winked, as much as to say he knew it. &ldquo;The missis
gives an eye to that, you see, Squire,&rdquo; he answered, in a side whisper.
&ldquo;She had been in the kitchen till you came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire took another ladleful. He went once or twice to every
dish, and drank champagne with all of us. But still Robert Ashton
did not come.</p>

<p>I slipped round to Mrs. Coney when the plum-pudding appeared,
whispering that I would take a slice to Jane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you shall, Johnny,&rdquo; she said, giving me some on a plate, and
putting a mince-pie beside it. &ldquo;She will have no luck unless she eats
a little of both pudding and pie on the first day of the year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane sat in a low elbow-chair before the fire, her head leaning on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
hand, her hair a little tumbled. It was very pretty hair, dark chestnut,
and her eyes were hazel. Robert Ashton was fair-haired and blue-eyed;
Saxon all over, and very good-looking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have brought you some pudding, Jane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Johnny! why did you leave the table? I can&rsquo;t eat it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Mrs. Coney says you are to; and some mince-pie also, or you&rsquo;ll
have no luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As if in obedience she ate a little of the pudding, cut a quarter of the
mince-pie with her fork, and ate that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, Johnny, that&rsquo;s quite enough for &lsquo;luck.&rsquo; Go back now to
your dinner; I dare say you&rsquo;ve not had any pudding yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay with you, and finish this: as it is going begging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She neither said yes nor no. She was looking frightfully uneasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you vexed that Robert Ashton&rsquo;s not here, Jane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not vexed, because I know he would have been here if he
could. I think something has happened to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stared at her. &ldquo;What! because he is a little late in coming?
Why, Jane, you must be nervous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She kept looking into the fire, her eyes fixed. I sat on a stool on
the other side of the hearth; the empty pudding-plate standing on the
rug between us, where I had put it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert was <em>sure</em> to come for this dinner, Johnny, all being well,
and to be in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me what you fear, Jane&mdash;and why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I will tell you,&rdquo; she said, after a pause. &ldquo;I should like to
tell some one. I wish I had told Robert when he called this morning;
but I was afraid he would laugh at me. You will laugh too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Jane Coney told it. In a low, dread voice, her eyes staring
into the fire as before, just as though they could see through the blaze
into the future.</p>

<p>Early that morning she had had a dream; a disagreeable, ugly
dream about Robert Ashton. She thought he was in some frightful
peril, that she cried to him to avoid it, or it would stop their marriage.
He seemed not to take the least notice of her, but to go right on to it,
and in the alarm this brought her, she awoke. I listened in silence,
saying nothing to the end; no, nor then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dream was so intensely <em>real</em>, Johnny. It seemed to be to-day;
this very day then dawning; and we both of us knew that it was; the
one before our marriage. I woke up in a fever; and but that it was
night and not day, should have had difficulty in persuading myself at
first that we were not really enacting the scene&mdash;it was, as I say, so
vividly real. And Robert went out to the peril, never heeding me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the peril?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I can&rsquo;t tell. A consciousness lay upon me that it was
something very bad and frightful; but of its nature I saw nothing. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
did not go to sleep again: it must have been about six o&rsquo;clock, but the
mornings are very dark, you know. I got up soon: what with this
dinner-party and other things, there has been a great deal to do to-day,
and I soon forgot my dream. Robert called after breakfast, and the
sight of him put me in mind of it. I felt a great inclination to tell him
to take especial care of himself; but he would only have laughed at
me. He drove away direct to the Timberdale Station, to take the train
for Worcester.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not say, though, what he had gone for to Worcester. To
get the ring and licence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not felt the smallest fear of the dream all along, Johnny,
since I awoke. Excepting for the few minutes Robert was here, I
don&rsquo;t remember even to have thought of it. But when his brothers
and Mr. West came in without him to-night, it flashed into my mind
like a dart. I felt sure then that something had happened. I dare say
we shall never be married now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jane!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Johnny Ludlow, I think it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To me it seemed to be growing serious. There might be nothing at
all in what she had said; most people would have said there was
nothing; but, sitting there in the quiet room listening to her earnest
voice, seeing her anxious face, a feeling came over me that there <em>was</em>.
What had become of Robert Ashton? Where could he be?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would give me that shawl of mamma&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said, pointing
to one on a chair. &ldquo;I feel cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was shivering when I put it over her pretty white shoulders and
arms. And yet the fire was roaring to the very top of the grate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alone here, while you were at dinner, I went over all sorts of
probabilities,&rdquo; she resumed, drawing the shawl round her as if she were
out in the snow. &ldquo;Of course there are five hundred things that might
happen to him, but I can only think of one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; for she had stopped. She seemed to be speaking very unwillingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he walked he would be almost sure to take the near way, across
the Ravine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was she ever coming to the point? I said nothing. It was better
to let her go on in her own way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you will say the idea is far-fetched, Johnny. What I
think is, that he may have fallen down the Ravine, in coming here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, I did think it far-fetched. I&rsquo;d as soon have expected her to
say fallen down the chimney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those zigzag paths are not very safe in good weather, especially the
one on the Timberdale side,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;With the snow on them,
perhaps ice, they are positively dangerous. One false step at the top&mdash;and
the fall might kill him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Put in this way, it seemed feasible enough. But yet&mdash;somehow I
did not take to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert Ashton is strong and agile, Jane. He has come down the
zigzag hundreds of times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seem to see him lying there, at the bottom of the Ravine,&rdquo; she
said, staring as before into the fire. &ldquo;I&mdash;wish&mdash;some of you would go
and look for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we had better. I&rsquo;ll make one. Who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Tom Coney. His mother had sent him to see after me. I
thought I&rsquo;d tell him&mdash;keeping counsel about the dream&mdash;that Robert
Ashton might have come to grief in the Ravine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of grief?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turned a summersault down the zigzag, and be lying with a leg
broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom&rsquo;s laugh displayed his small white teeth: the notion amused
him excessively. &ldquo;What else would you like to suppose, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any rate, Jane thinks so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned round then, the tears in her eyes, and went up to Tom in
an outburst of grief. It took him aback.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom! Tom! if no one goes to see after him, I think I must go
myself. I cannot bear the suspense much longer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Jenny girl, what has taken you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>That</em> had taken her. The fear that Robert Ashton might be lying
disabled, or dead, in the Ravine. Tom Coney called Tod quietly out
of the dining-room, and we started. Putting on our dark great-coats
in silence, we went out at the back-door, which was nearest the Ravine.
Jane came with us to the gate. I never saw eyes so eager as hers
were, as she gazed across the snow in the moonlight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;we had better turn our trousers up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The expedition was not pleasant, I can assure you, especially the
going down the zigzag. Jane was right about its being slippery: we
had to hold on by the trees and bushes, and tread cautiously. When
pretty near the bottom, Tod made a false step, and shot down into the
snow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; he roared out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any bones broken?&rdquo; asked Tom Coney, who could hardly speak
for laughing. Tod growled, and shied a handful of snow at him.</p>

<p>But the slip brought home to us the probability of the fear about
Robert Ashton. To slip from where Tod did was fun; to slip from the
top of the opposite zigzag, quite another thing. The snow here at the
bottom was up to our calves, and our black evening trousers got rolled
up higher. The moonlight lay cold and white on the Ravine: the
clustering trees, thick in summer, were leafless now. Had any fellow
been gazing down from the top, we must have looked, to him, like
three black-coated undertakers, gliding along to a funeral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; cried Tod: &ldquo;if Ashton did lose his footing, he
wouldn&rsquo;t come to such mortal grief. The depth of snow would save
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he did fall,&rdquo; said Tom Coney, stoutly. &ldquo;Bob
Ashton&rsquo;s as sure-footed as a hare. But for Jane&rsquo;s being so miserable,
I&rsquo;d have said, flatly, I wouldn&rsquo;t come out on any such wild-goose errand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On we went, wading through the snow. Some of us looked round
for the ghost&rsquo;s light, and did not see it. But rumour said that it never
came on a bright moonlit night. Here we were at last!&mdash;at the foot
of the other zigzag. But Robert Ashton wasn&rsquo;t here. And, the best
proof that he had <em>not</em> fallen, was the unbroken surface of the snow.
Not so much as a rabbit had scudded across to disturb it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; said Tom Coney. &ldquo;He has not come to grief at all.
It stands to reason that a fellow must have heaps to do the day before
his wedding, if it&rsquo;s only in burning his old letters from other sweethearts.
Bob had a heap of them, no doubt; and couldn&rsquo;t get away in
time for dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had better go on to the Court, and see,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that be hanged!&rdquo; cried the other two in a breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I shall. It&rsquo;s not much farther. You can go back, or not, as
you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>This</em> zigzag, though steeper than the one on our side, was not so
slippery. Perhaps the sun had shone on it in the day and melted the
snow. I went up it nearly as easily as in good weather. Tod and
Coney, thinking better of the turning back, came after me.</p>

<p>We should have been at Timberdale Court in five minutes, taking
the short-cut over hedges and ditches, but for an adventure by the
way, which I have not just here space to tell about. It had nothing to
do with Robert Ashton. Getting to the Court, we hammered at it till
the door was opened. The servant started back in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness me!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I thought it was master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the master?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not come home, sir. He has not been in since he left this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was all out. Instead of pitchpolling into Crabb Ravine and
breaking his limbs, Bob Ashton had not got back from Worcester. It
was very strange, though, what could be keeping him, and the Court
was nearly in a commotion over it.</p>

<p>When we got back to the Farm, they were laying the table for the
wedding-breakfast. Plenty of kickshaws now, and some lovely flowers.
The ladies, helping, had their gowns turned up. This helping had not
been in the evening&rsquo;s programme; but things seemed to have been
turned upside down, and they were glad to seize upon it. Jane and
her sister, Mrs. West, sat alone by the drawing-room fire, never saying
a word to one another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny, I don&rsquo;t half like this,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Todhetley to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like what, good mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This absence of Robert Ashton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know that I liked it either.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Morning came. In an uncertainty such as this, people go to each
other&rsquo;s houses indiscriminately. The first train came in from Worcester
before it was well light; but it did not bring Robert Ashton. As to
the snow on the ground, it was pretty well beaten now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t travel by that slow parliamentary thing: he&rsquo;ll come
by the express to South Crabb Junction,&rdquo; said Tom Coney, thinking
he would cheer away the general disappointment. Jane we had not
seen.</p>

<p>The express would be at the Junction between nine and ten. A
whole lot of us went down there. It was not farther off than Timberdale
Station, but the opposite way. I don&rsquo;t think one of us was more
eager than another, unless it was the Squire. The thing was getting
serious, he told us; and he went puffing about like a man looking for
his head.</p>

<p>To witness the way he seized upon the doors when the express
steamed in, and put his old red nose inside all the carriages, looking for
Robert Ashton, was a rare sight. The guard laid hold of his arm,
saying he&rsquo;d come to damage. But Robert Ashton was not in the train.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He may come yet,&rdquo; said old Coney, looking fit to cry. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll
be a train in again at Timberdale. Or, he may drive over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But every one felt that he would <em>not</em> come. Something told us so.
It was only making believe to one another, saying he would.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall go to Worcester by the next down train,&rdquo; said the Squire
to old Coney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next does not stop here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d better stop it for me,&rdquo; said the Squire, defiantly. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t come, Coney. You must remain to give Jane away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if there&rsquo;s no bridegroom to give her to?&rdquo; debated old Coney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There may be. You must remain on the strength of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The down train came up, and obeyed the signal to stop made by the
station-master. The Squire, Tod, and Tom Coney got in, and it
steamed on again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now mind, I shall conduct this search,&rdquo; the Squire said to the
others with a frown. &ldquo;You young fellows don&rsquo;t know your right hand
from your left in a business of this sort. We must go about it
systematically, and find out the different places that Robert Ashton
went to yesterday, and the people he saw.&rdquo; Tod and Tom Coney told
us this later.</p>

<p>When they arrived at Worcester, the first man they saw at Shrubb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Hill Station was Harry Coles, who had been seeing somebody off by
the train, which was rather curious; for his brother, Fred Coles, was
Robert Ashton&rsquo;s great chum, and was to be groom&rsquo;s-man at the
wedding. Harry Coles said his brother had met Ashton by appointment
the previous day, and went with him to the Registrar&rsquo;s office for
the marriage licence&mdash;which was supplied to them by Mr. Clifton
himself. After that, they went to the jeweller&rsquo;s, and chose the
wedding-ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what after that?&rdquo; cried the impatient Squire.</p>

<p>Harry Coles did not know what. His brother had come back to
their office early in the afternoon&mdash;about one o&rsquo;clock&mdash;saying Ashton
was going, or had gone, home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell which he said&mdash;going, or gone?&rdquo; demanded the
Squire, getting red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Harry Coles. &ldquo;I was busy with some estimates,
and did not pay particular attention to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you ought to have paid it, sir,&rdquo; retorted the Squire. &ldquo;Your
brother?&mdash;where is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone over to Timberdale ages ago. He started the first thing this
morning, Squire; a big coat thrown over his wedding toggery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire growled, as a relief to his feelings, not knowing what in
the world to do. He suddenly said he&rsquo;d go to the Registrar&rsquo;s office,
and started for Edgar Street.</p>

<p>Mr. Clifton was not there, but a clerk was. Yes, Mr. Ashton of
Timberdale had been there the previous day, he said, in answer to the
Squire, and had got his licence. The governor (meaning Mr. Clifton,
who knew the Ashtons and the Coneys well) had joked a bit with
young Ashton, when he gave it. As to telling where Ashton of
Timberdale and Mr. Coles had gone to afterwards, the clerk did not
know at all.</p>

<p>So there was nothing to be gathered at the Registrar&rsquo;s office, and the
Squire turned his steps up the town again, Tod and Coney following
him like two tame lambs; for he wouldn&rsquo;t let them make a suggestion
or put in a word edgeways. He was on his way to the jeweller&rsquo;s now:
but as he had omitted to ask Harry Coles which of the jewellers&rsquo; shops
the ring was bought at, he took them all in succession, and hit upon
the right one after some difficulty.</p>

<p>He learnt nothing there, either. Mr. Ashton of Timberdale had
bought the ring and keeper, and paid for them, the master said. Of
course every one knew the young lady was Miss Jane Coney: he had
brought one of her rings as a guide for size: a chased gold ring, with
small garnet stones in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not asking for rings and stones,&rdquo; interrupted the Squire,
wrathfully. &ldquo;I want to know if Mr. Ashton said where he was going
to afterwards?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He said never a word about it,&rdquo; returned the master. &ldquo;When
they went out of here&mdash;young Fred Coles was with him&mdash;they took
the way towards the Hop Market.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire went to the Crown next&mdash;the inn used by the Ashtons
of Timberdale. Robert Ashton had called in the previous day, about
one o&rsquo;clock, the waiter said, taking a little bread-and-cheese, observing
that he had no time for anything else, and a glass of table-beer. Mr.
Coles had come down Broad Street with him, as far as the inn door,
when they shook hands and parted; Mr. Coles going back again. The
waiter thought Mr. Ashton was not in the house above five minutes at
the most.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you know where he went to next?&rdquo; urged the
Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the waiter replied. The impression on his mind was, that
Mr. Ashton&rsquo;s business in Worcester was over, and that he was returning
home again.</p>

<p>The Squire moved slowly up Broad Street, more gloomy than an
owl, his hands in his pockets, his nose blue. He boasted of his
systematic abilities, as applied to seekings and searchings, but he knew
no more what to be at next than the man in the moon. Turning up
the Cross, he came to an anchor outside the linen-draper&rsquo;s shop;
propping his back against the window, as if the hanging silks had
offended him. There he stood staring up at St. Nicholas&rsquo;s clock
opposite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; said he, virtually giving in, &ldquo;I think we had better talk to
the police. Here&rsquo;s one coming along now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the policeman was abreast, the Squire took his hands from his
pockets, and pinned the man by his button-hole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ashton of Timberdale?&mdash;oh, he has got into trouble, sir,&rdquo; was
the man&rsquo;s ready answer. &ldquo;He is before the magistrates now, on a
charge of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The railway omnibus, coming along at the moment, partially drowned
the word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charge of <em>what</em>?&rdquo; roared the Squire.</p>

<p>The policeman repeated it. The omnibus was making a frightful
rattle, and the Squire only just caught it now. With a great cry he
dashed over to the fly-stand, got into one, and ordered it to gallop
away with him. Tom Coney and Tod barely escaped having to hang
on behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drive like mad!&rdquo; stamped the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the man, obeying. &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on, will you, sir! To the deuce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the police-court,&rdquo; corrected Tom Coney.</p>

<p>Arrived there, the Squire left them to pay the fare, and fought his
way inside. The first thing his spectacles caught sight of distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
was the fair Saxon face and fine form of Robert Ashton, standing, a
prisoner, in the criminal dock.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>At the Farm, things were in a state more easily imagined than
described. The carriages came bowling up, bringing the guests. The
four bridesmaids wore pale-blue silk, trimmed with white fur. Jane
was dressed. In passing her door, I saw her. They had sent me up
to fetch something from Tom&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it not a mockery, Johnny?&rdquo; she said, letting me enter. And
her poor pale face looked more fit for a burying than a wedding, and
her eyes had dark circles round them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you mean your dress, Jane, I never saw anything less like a
mockery, or more like a princess&rsquo;s in a fairy tale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was of rich white silk; a delicate wreath of myrtle and orange-blossoms
on her chestnut hair. The veil lay upon the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean, Johnny. There will be no wedding at
North Crabb Church to-day&mdash;and nothing can have been more foolish
than to prepare me for it. Oh, Johnny! if I could only go to sleep till
ten years hence, and never wake up between!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the gate waited the carriages, their postillions in scarlet
jackets; the company, in their fine plumage, jostled each other in the
nooks and corners of the house; the maids, wearing a bright uniform
of purple gowns and white muslin aprons, ran about wildly. Every
two minutes, old Coney went up to a staircase window that faced
Timberdale, looking out to see whether Robert Ashton was coming&mdash;like
Sister Anne, in &ldquo;Bluebeard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Twelve o&rsquo;clock! It was like a knell booming out; and the carriages
went away with the company. A fine ending to a wedding!</p>

<p>I was standing at the back-door, disconsolate as the moaning wind,
when the Timberdale Station fly came rattling along. A gentleman
put his head out of it, to tell the driver to stop. He got down, and
came limping up to me. It was Mr. West&rsquo;s partner, old Lawyer
Cockermuth, who had declined an invitation to the wedding, because
of gout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said he, catching me by the shoulder, &ldquo;I want to say
half-a-dozen words to Mr. Coney. Can you manage to bring him out
to me, or smuggle me into any little place where we can be alone? I
suppose the house is chock-full of wedding-people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have brought bad news of Robert Ashton!&rdquo; I said, in sudden
conviction. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, so I <em>have</em>,&rdquo; he answered confidentially. &ldquo;It will soon be
known to every one, but I should like to break it to Coney first. I&rsquo;ve
come over to do it. Robert Ashton is in custody for murder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt my face turn as pale as a girl&rsquo;s. &ldquo;For <em>murder</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Old Cockermuth&rsquo;s face grew long as he nodded. &ldquo;He is in custody
for nothing less than the murder of his brother-in-law, Bird. Yesterday&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A smothered cry behind us, and I turned sharply. There stood
Jane. She had seen Cockermuth&rsquo;s arrival, and came down, knowing
he must have brought bad news. The white robe and wreath were
gone, and she wore an everyday dress of violet merino.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear! my dear, be calm!&rdquo; cried the old lawyer, in a
fright. &ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake shut us in somewhere, Johnny Ludlow!
We shall have the whole pack out upon us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some of the pack did come, before he could be shut up. And there
we were&mdash;hearing that Robert Ashton had been taken up for murder.</p>

<p>It appeared that, after quitting the Crown on the previous day, he
met his sister&rsquo;s husband, Captain Bird&mdash;from habit, people still accorded
him his title. Captain Bird told him Lucy was dangerously ill, and
asked him to go and see her. Robert went at once to their lodgings.
What exactly happened there, no one as yet knew; but Robert and
Bird got quarrelling. Robert did not come out again. In the morning
(this morning) the neighbours heard a hue-and-cry; and on the door
being opened by two policemen, Bird was found lying in the passage
dead, as was supposed, and Robert Ashton was given into custody for
his murder.</p>

<p>Jane touched me on the arm, and I followed her into the large,
empty dining-room. That miserable breakfast! waiting for those who
could not sit down to it. The evergreens on the walls seemed to look
faded; the flowers on the table to have lost their first freshness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see I was right, Johnny,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That dream was a
dream of warning. And sent as one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It did look like it. But dreams are things you can&rsquo;t lay hold of; no,
nor altogether believe in. Standing by the cold grate, she began to
shiver. In the confusion, the servants had let the fire go out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would forget the dream, if I were you, Jane. Where&rsquo;s the use of
people having dreams&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say warnings, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;if they cannot see how to make use of them? Call them
warnings, an you like the word better. They are of no good at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Johnny, if I could only die! It was hard enough to bear when
he was only missing; but now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was just as though she never meant to leave off shivering. I went
to hunt for some sticks, and saw our cook, Molly, in the kitchen
amongst the maids. Trust her for being in the thick of any gossip.
Bringing the sticks back, I pushed them in, and they soon crackled up
into a blaze. Jane sat down and watched them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid, Jane, if I were you. There must be some
mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid&mdash;in one sense. That Robert has done nothing
wrong willingly, I know. But&mdash;he is rather passionate; and there&rsquo;s no
telling how they might provoke him. If there is much prolonged
suspense; a trial, or anything of that sort&mdash;well, I suppose I shall live
through it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How hopeless she looked! her head bent, her eyes cast down. Just
then there was a cry outside for Jane. &ldquo;Jane!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go out, Johnny, and say I am all right. <em>Pray</em> to them to leave
me alone. Tell mamma not to come in; I am easier by myself&mdash;and
the fire&rsquo;s burning up. They have gone calling upstairs; they wouldn&rsquo;t
think I am here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was there anything incoherent in her words? I looked at her
narrowly. I suppose that they sounded something like it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One has been coming to soothe me, and another has been coming;
I haven&rsquo;t known how to bear it. They mean it in kindness&mdash;great
kindness; but I would so much rather be alone. You go now,
Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I shut her in. And whispered to Mrs. Coney that she was praying
to be left.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how the day went on, except that it was miserably
uncomfortable. We had some cold beef in the everyday dining-room,
and old Coney, after saying he&rsquo;d have given a thousand pounds out of
his pocket for it not to have happened, went and smoked a pipe with
Cockermuth in the best kitchen. Dusk began to come on.</p>

<p>Why! who was that&mdash;driving up in Robert Ashton&rsquo;s dog-cart?
Robert! Robert himself? Yes, it was; and the Squire, and Tod, and
Tom Coney with him. The dog-cart had gone to the station to wait for
the Squire and the other two: they came, bringing Robert Ashton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it all right, Mr. Ashton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite right, Johnny. You did not think it could be wrong, did
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are out on bail?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out for good. There has been no real damage done. I wonder
where Jane is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to her. She has been wishing she was dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one in the house scented his presence. I opened the door of the
large oak-room. Jane was kneeling on the hearthrug, her face buried
in the cushion of the arm-chair. She started up at the noise, and
stood like one turned to stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Robert?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I do believe she thought it was not real&mdash;his ghost, or something.
He went up in silence, slightly smiling&mdash;he was always a quiet-mannered
man&mdash;and holding out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is I, myself, Jane. You look as though you doubted it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a great cry she fell forward. Robert caught her to his breast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
I was going away when he hastily called to me. For the first time in
her life she had fainted away. The thing had been too much for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get some water, Johnny. Don&rsquo;t call any one. She&rsquo;ll soon come to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was water on the table; wine too. He gave Jane some of
both. And then she listened to his story, leaning on his arm, and crying
as softly and peacefully as a little child.</p>

<p>Those outside were listening to the wonderful tale. When I went
out, they had gathered in the best kitchen, round the Squire, who had
gone there in search of old Coney. The Squire&rsquo;s glowing face was a
sight to be seen. Mrs. Coney had sat down on the mahogany bench;
her hands lifted. Coney stood with his pipe held at arm&rsquo;s-length. As
to Mrs. Todhetley, the tears were running down her cheeks in a stream.</p>

<p>It was quite true that Lucy Bird was very ill. Robert saw her in
bed. As he was leaving, Bird began upon the old grievance&mdash;that he
should have some of Lucy&rsquo;s money advanced in a lump. He wanted
it for his cards and dice, you see. Robert told him, No: as he had
told him all along. An associate of Bird&rsquo;s was there; a very bad man,
named Dawler. They got Robert to take a friendly glass of wine&mdash;which
purported to be sherry: and from that moment he lost all power,
and partly consciousness. The wine was drugged. Their object, no
doubt, had been to partly stupefy him, and so induce him to sign an
undertaking to hand over the money to Bird. But they had made the
potion a trifle too strong, not calculating the effect it would take on
a young and habitually sober man. Robert fell into a deep sleep, from
which it was impossible to arouse him all night: as to writing, his hands
were as if dead. Late in the morning he awoke; and, bit by bit,
realized where he was and what had passed. He was a little stupid
even then, but sensible enough to remember that it was his wedding-day,
and to foresee that he might have some trouble to get away from
the house. On attempting to leave, Bird and Dawler placed themselves
in the passage to prevent him. There was a hot contest. Robert
Ashton, a stronger man than either of the others, but aware that all his
strength was not then at his own command, seized a knotted stick, or
club, that was lying in a corner, and lifted it to fight his way through.
Dawler struck at it, to get it out of his hand, and struck it against
Bird&rsquo;s head with frightful force. The fellow dropped as one dead, and
the door was burst open by the neighbours and policemen. The excitement,
perhaps the exertion, acting on Robert Ashton&rsquo;s only partly
recovered state, turned him stupid again: the people took him to be
drunk, and Dawler gave him in charge for murder.</p>

<p>That was the history. When the Squire had got into the police-court,
Robert Ashton (who was nearly himself again through the
remedies the doctor had given him in the police-station) was telling his
tale. Dawler was contradicting him, and swearing hard and fast that
it was a case of deliberate murder. The magistrates invited the Squire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to a seat beside them: and the first thing he did was to break into a hot
tantrum, vowing Robert Ashton couldn&rsquo;t be guilty. How it would have
terminated no one knew, but Lucy saved him.</p>

<p>Lucy saved him. A wan, haggard young woman wrapped in an old
shawl, staggered into the justice-room, to the front of the room. It
was Lucy Bird. She had come crawling through the streets to tell the
truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother Robert did not attempt to strike any one,&rdquo; she said in
low, weak, earnest tones. &ldquo;He only held the club in his hand. I saw
it all, for I stood by. It was Dawler who threw his weight upon the
club, and struck down my husband. Robert fell too; pushed down by
Dawler. This is the sole truth, before Heaven!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They believed her. The best was, that Bird was not dead at all,
only stunned; and the next to appear in court was himself, with a big
white plaister on his forehead. Discovering his wife&rsquo;s flight to the
magistrates, he thought it well to go after her: there was no knowing
what plots might be in the wind. He had the grace to acknowledge that
the blow was an accident. The whole bench shook hands with Robert
Ashton, telling Bird and the other man significantly that they had
better take care what they were about for the future: and the Squire
brought him home in triumph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where is Robert?&rdquo; asked old Coney and the rest. Why, in
there with Jane: where else should he be? They burst into the oak-room
in a body, and found him trying on the ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we have a dinner to-night?&rdquo; asked old Coney.
&ldquo;Last night&rsquo;s was only half a dinner, through one bother or another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; cried the Squire. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only thing against it was&mdash;as Mrs. Coney said&mdash;that no dinner
was prepared. Unless they could put up with a cold one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And glad to do so,&rdquo; spoke up everybody. So the cold meats were
brought from the larder, and the fowls from the breakfast-table, and
laid in the everyday dining-parlour. The ladies were in their ordinary
gowns, and there was no room for elbows, but we made up with
laughter. Sixteen this evening; Fred Coles being there, and old
Cockermuth, who sat down in spite of the gout. Afterwards we went
off by the light of the stars to summon the company to the morrow&rsquo;s
wedding; it was good to go knocking at the doors with the news.
Whilst the servants at the Farm, with Molly to help them, began
cooking fresh fowls for the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s about all. There was never a better wedding seen, and
the scarlet jackets of the post-boys dazzled one&rsquo;s eyes in the morning
sun. Robert Ashton was calm and quiet in church; Jane too, and not
a bit nervous. The chief speech at the breakfast was undertaken by
the Squire, so you may give a guess what it was like; but it didn&rsquo;t
spoil the wedding-cake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Jane was shut up with her mother when the time came for starting,
and came out in a flood of tears. She was leaving her childhood&rsquo;s
home, you see. Robert would have hurried her straight to the carriage,
but the company wouldn&rsquo;t be done out of their leave-taking. I was
the last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for all, Johnny,&rdquo; she cried, wringing my hand as she
went down the path. &ldquo;They were all very kind to me yesterday, but
it seemed that you were kindest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the next minute, both of them, with the door shut, and the
carriage away towards South Crabb Junction. The people cheered,
the cocks crew, and the old shoes flew after them in a shower.</p>

<h2><span class="f9">VI.</span><br />

HARDLY WORTH TELLING.</h2>


<p>You remember what I, Johnny Ludlow, said in the last paper&mdash;that
on our way to Timberdale Court we met with an adventure, which I
had not then time to tell of. It was this.</p>

<p>After our race through Crabb Ravine by moonlight, looking for
Robert Ashton, we went on to Timberdale Court as fast as the snowy
ground would admit of, Joseph Todhetley and Tom Coney rushing on
in front, I after them&mdash;they were older and stronger than I was. Not
by the ordinary highway, but over fields and hedges and ditches,
straight as the crow flies, wishing to save time. Instead of saving time,
we lost it, for though the road, had we taken it, was longer, the snow
was beaten there; whereas it was lying deep across the country and
had to be waded through. But you can&rsquo;t always bring common-sense
to bear at the moment it&rsquo;s wanted. And if we had looked like three
undertakers at a funeral, stalking after one another in the Ravine, with
our dark coats showing out against the white snow, I&rsquo;m sure we must
have looked still more like it in the open ground.</p>

<p>At the far corner of the square meadow was a cow-shed, unused since
the autumn, when Ashton of Timberdale had caused the fields about
here to be ploughed. Beyond the shed, touching its walls, ran a brook;
and it brought us up. We had meant to take it at a flying leap; but
the snow had melted there, and the brook was swollen. It was not
agreeable to run the chance of pitching in, and it seemed that we
should have to make for the gate, lower down. Standing for a moment
to reconnoitre, there broke on our ears a low moan; and then another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; cried Tod, &ldquo;is that the ghost?&rdquo; I said in that last paper,
as any one may see, that we had looked out for the ghost in the Ravine.
The moaning came again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t believe it is in the cow-shed!&rdquo; exclaimed Tom Coney.
And he went round to the door and shook it open.</p>

<p>Pitch dark inside and the same moaning, soft and low. Tom Coney
had some lights in his pocket, and struck one. Well! we were
astonished. On the ground lay a woman&mdash;or girl&mdash;and a very little
child. She had a young face, with anxious eyes and feverish cheeks.
She said she was dying, and so answered our questions; but we had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
kneel down to hear her. She had walked across the country from somewhere
in Gloucestershire, carrying her baby of a fortnight old, but the
weakness and fever overtook her. Two nights ago she had crept into
the shed, and lain there, unsuspected, ever since.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why did you leave your home?&rdquo; inquired Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stay for the shame,&rdquo; was the nearly inaudible answer:
and but that our ears were good ones, we should not have caught it.
If we would but fetch her a drop of water for the love of Christ, she
said, as we got up.</p>

<p>It was impossible to help wondering whether God had not allowed
Robert Ashton to be lost on purpose to bring us round there. But for
our passing, both she and the baby must very soon have died, for the
shed was quite out of the reach of any road likely to be traversed.
We must have seemed to her like angels of mercy. Perhaps we
were made use of as such that night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you lain here all that time&mdash;two nights and days&mdash;without
food?&rdquo; asked Tod, in his softest voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without food, sir, and without drink. Oh, for a drop of water!
If you could only bring it me, I should die easier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We got some clean snow and moistened her lips with it. She gave
a sobbing cry as it trickled down her throat: Tom Coney said it was
choking, but I thought it was joy. To a poor creature in a burning
fever, lying without any sort of drink for days and nights, the fresh
cold snow must have tasted like dew from heaven. She motioned
that the baby should have some, but we were afraid: it looked to be
dying.</p>

<p>What could be done with her? To carry her away was not practicable&mdash;and
she seemed too ill besides. Tom Coney offered to cover up
the baby under his coat and take it to the Court for food and shelter;
but she clutched it closer to her side as it lay on her arm, and faintly
said it couldn&rsquo;t do without her. Shutting the shed door again, we got
quickly to Timberdale Court, found Robert Ashton was not at home, as
you heard, and asked for the housekeeper, Mrs. Broom.</p>

<p>She was sitting in her little carpeted room, off the big kitchen, with
one of the maids. They were sewing white bows on a lot of caps, and
wondering what had become of the master. To be burst in upon by
us, all three telling the story at once of the woman and child, pretty
nearly scared good old Mother Broom&rsquo;s senses away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are just playing a trick upon me, young gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is as true as that we are here, Mrs. Broom; it is true as gospel.
They&rsquo;ll both be dead if something&rsquo;s not done for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never heard of such a thing,&rdquo; she exclaimed, beginning to
stir about. &ldquo;Lying in that cow-shed for two days without help! You
ought to have brought the poor baby away with you, sirs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t let it come.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded her saying that. A fortnight-old baby
lying in the shed in this cold!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it will make much difference in the long-run, whether
the baby stays in the shed or comes out of it,&rdquo; said Tom Coney. &ldquo;If
it sees to-morrow&rsquo;s dawn, I shall wonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this <em>is</em> a fine start!&rdquo; cried Mother Broom. &ldquo;And the master
never to have come home&mdash;that&rsquo;s another,&rdquo; she went on. For, what
to do, she didn&rsquo;t know the least in the world, and was like a woman
with a lost head.</p>

<p>We left the matter to her, carrying some things to the shed as we
passed it on our way home&mdash;blankets and a pillow, fresh water, milk-and-water
for the baby, and a candle and matches. One of the women-servants
was to come after us, with hot broth and wine.</p>

<p>When we reached Crabb Cot, the dismay there at hearing Robert
Ashton had not turned up, was diversified by this news, which we told
of. Not that they thought very much of it: the woman was only a
poor tramp, they said; and such things&mdash;fevers, and that&mdash;happen to
poor tramps every day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think the baby&rsquo;s dying?&rdquo; asked Charles Ashton, the
parson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nearly sure it is,&rdquo; said Tom Coney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a kind of woman, you know, that ought to be committed
for fourteen-days&rsquo; hard labour,&rdquo; observed the Squire, fiercely, who was
in a frightfully cross mood with the various mishaps and uncertainties
of the evening. &ldquo;Seems to be very sickly and humble, you say,
Mr. Johnny! Hold your tongue, sir; what should you know about
it? These women tramps bring death on their infants through
exposure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said old Coney. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d punish &rsquo;em, Squire, if I
were a magistrate like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But what do you think Parson Ashton did? When the dog-cart
had taken him and Mr. and Mrs. James Ashton to the Court&mdash;where
they were to stay all night&mdash;he started off for the shed, and did not
come away from it until he had baptized the baby.</p>

<p>We heard nothing more about it until the next day&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t
suppose any one has forgotten what sort of a miserable day that was,
at old Coney&rsquo;s Farm. How the wedding never took place, and Robert
Ashton was still missing, and Jane Coney was dressed in her bridal
robes for nothing, and the breakfast could not be eaten, and we guests
staring in each other&rsquo;s faces like so many helpless dummies. What
news we had of it then, came from Charles Ashton: he had been to
the shed again that morning. Whilst the carriages stood waiting at
the gate, the post-boys&rsquo; scarlet jackets flaming in the sun, and the
company indoors sat looking hopelessly for the bridegroom, Parson
Ashton talked about it in a corner to Mrs. Coney and the Squire&rsquo;s wife:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
both of them in their grand silk plumage then, one plum-coloured, the
other sea-green, with feathers for top-knots.</p>

<p>The little baby was dead, Charles Ashton said. The mother had
been removed to a shelter in Timberdale village, and was being cared
for. The doctor, called in to her, Darbyshire, thought she might get
over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You baptized the child, I hear, Charles?&rdquo; said Mrs. Coney, to the
parson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you name it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucy. Something in the mother&rsquo;s face put me in mind of my
sister, and it was the name I first thought of. I asked the mother what
she would have it called. Anything, she answered; it did not matter.
Neither did it, for the little thing was dying then. Hot-water bottles
and other remedies were tried last night as soon as they could be had,
to get warmth into the child&mdash;to renew its life, in fact; but nothing
availed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where was the woman taken to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Jael Batty&rsquo;s. Jael consented to take her in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is but another case of the old, sad story?&rdquo; groaned
Mrs. Todhetley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing else. And she, poor thing, is not much more than a girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Charles, I tell you what. It may be all very consistent for
you clergymen&mdash;men of forgiveness, and that&mdash;to waste your compassion
over these poor stray creatures, but I think it might do more good
sometimes if you gave them blame,&rdquo; spoke Mrs. Coney, severely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are times and seasons when you cannot express blame, however
much it may be deserved,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The worst of it in
these cases is, that we rarely know there exists cause for censure before
it is too late for any censure to avail, or avert the evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What with the astounding events of the day, connected with the
interrupted wedding, nothing more was said or thought of the affair.
Except by Jane. When she and I were in the big dining-room
together&mdash;I trying to blow up the fire, and she in full dread that
Robert Ashton would have to be tried for his life at the Worcester
Spring Assizes, and lie in prison until then&mdash;she suddenly spoke of it,
interrupting the noise made by the crackling of the wood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that poor baby&rsquo;s dead, Johnny! What a happy fate&mdash;not to
grow up to trouble. Charles named it Lucy, I hear. I should like to
see the poor mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See her for what, Jane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is in distress, and so am I. I don&rsquo;t suppose she has a corner
to turn to for comfort in the wide world. I have not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not so very long after this that <em>her</em> distress was over. Robert
Ashton arrived in triumph, and so put an end to it. One might suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Jane would no longer have remembered that other one&rsquo;s distress;
what with the impromptu dinner, where we had no room for our
elbows, and the laughter, and the preparations for the next day&rsquo;s
wedding.</p>

<p>But the matter had taken hold of Jane Coney&rsquo;s mind, and she
reverted to it on the morrow before going away. When the wedding-breakfast
was over, and she&mdash;nevermore Jane Coney, but Jane Ashton&mdash;had
changed her dress and was saying good-bye to her mother
upstairs, she suddenly spoke of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma, I want to ask you to do something for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you see after that poor young woman who was found in the
shed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Naturally Mrs. Coney was taken by surprise. She didn&rsquo;t much like it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After that young woman, Jane?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Broom has seen to her,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Coney, in a voice that
sounded very frozen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, dear,&rdquo; said Jane, &ldquo;I was comparing myself with her
yesterday; wondering which of us was the worst off, the more
miserable. I thought I was. I almost felt that I could have changed
places with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jane!&rdquo; angrily interjected Mrs. Coney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did. She knew the extent of her trouble, she could see all that
it involved; I did not see the extent of mine. I suppose it is always
thus&mdash;that other people&rsquo;s sorrows seem light when compared with our
own. The reason must no doubt be that we cannot realize theirs,
whilst we realize ours only too keenly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, I don&rsquo;t care to talk of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor I much&mdash;but hear me for a minute, mother. God has been so
merciful to me, and she is still as she was, that I&mdash;I should like to do
what I can for her when we come back again, and comfort and keep
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep her from want, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, child, she has been&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know what she has been,&rdquo;
gravely rebuked Mrs. Coney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I do, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a poor outcast, Jane; with neither home to go to, nor
friends to look upon her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane burst into tears: they had been hardly kept down since she
had begun to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so, mother. But what was I yesterday? If Robert had been
tried for his life, and condemned, I should have felt like an outcast;
perhaps been looked upon as no better than one by the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness, Jane, I wish you&rsquo;d exercise your common sense,&rdquo; cried
Mrs. Coney, losing patience. &ldquo;I tell you she <em>is</em> an outcast, and has
forfeited home and friends. She has been a great sinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, if she had a home and friends, there would be no need to
succour her. As to sin&mdash;perhaps we can save her from that for the
future. My gratitude for the mercy shown to <em>me</em> is such that I feel
as if I could take her to my bosom; it seems to my mind that I ought
to do something for her, that she has been thrown in my way that I
should do it. Mother, it is my last petition to you: see after her a
little for me until we come back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, dear; as you make this point of it,&rdquo; concluded Mrs.
Coney, relenting just a little. And then Jane began to cry hysterically;
and Tom Coney knocked at the door, saying time was up.</p>

<p>Mrs. Coney was not a hard-hearted woman, just the opposite: but
only those who live in rural parts of the country can imagine the
tricks and turns of regular tramps, and what a bad lot some of them
are. They deceive you with no end of a plausible tale, and stare
pitifully in your face whilst they tell it. Not long before this, a case
had happened where both our house and the Coneys&rsquo; had been taken
in. A woman in jagged widows&rsquo; garments presented herself at the
door of Crabb Cot and asked to see the Squire. Her shoes wanted
mending, and one side of her face was bandaged up. Mrs. Todhetley
went to her. Of all pitiable tales that poor woman told the most: it
would have melted a heart of stone. She came from near Droitwich,
she said: her husband had worked under Sir John Pakington; that is,
had been a labourer on part of his estate, Westwood Park. She lost
her husband and grown-up son the past autumn with fever; she caught
it herself, and was reduced to a skeleton, lost her cottage home through
the things being seized for rent, and went to live with a married
daughter in Oxfordshire. Cancer had appeared in her cheek, the
daughter could not keep her, for she and all her children were down
with sickness, and the husband had no work&mdash;and she, the widow, was
making her way by easy walking-stages to Worcester, there to try and
get into the infirmary. What she wanted at Crabb Cot was&mdash;not to
beg, either money or food: money she could do without, food she could
not eat&mdash;but to implore the gentleman (meaning the Squire) to give
her a letter to the infirmary doctors, so that they might take her in.</p>

<p>I can tell you that she took <em>us</em> in&mdash;every one of us. The Squire,
coming up during the conference, surrendered without fight. Questions
were put to her about Droitwich and Ombersley, which she answered
at once. There could be no mistaking that she knew all the neighbourhood
about there well, and Sir John and Lady Pakington into the
bargain. I think it was that that threw us off our guard. Mrs. Todhetley,
brimming over with compassion, offered her some light refreshment,
broth or milk. She said she could not swallow either, &ldquo;it went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
against her,&rdquo; but she&rsquo;d be thankful for a drink of water. Molly, the
greatest termagant to tramps and beggars in general, brought out a
half-pint bottle of store cordial, made by her own hands, of sweetened
blackberry juice and spice, for the woman to put in her pocket and sip,
on her journey to Worcester. Mrs. Todhetley gave her a pair of good
shoes and some shillings, and two old linen handkerchiefs for the face;
and the Squire, putting on his writing spectacles, wrote a letter to Mr.
Carden, begging him to see if anything, in the shape of medical aid,
could be done for the bearer. The woman burst into tears of thankfulness,
and went away with her presents, including the letter, Molly
the cross-grained actually going out to open the back-gate for her.</p>

<p>And now would anybody <em>believe</em> that this woman had only then
come out of the Coneys&rsquo; house&mdash;where she had been with the same
tale and request, and had received nearly the same relief? We never
saw or heard of her again. The note did not reach Mr. Carden; no
such patient applied to the infirmary. She was a clever impostor;
and we got to think that the cheek had only been rubbed up with a
little blistering-salve. Many another similar thing I could tell of&mdash;and
every one of them true. So you must not wonder at Mrs. Coney&rsquo;s
unwillingness to interfere with this latest edition in the tramp line.</p>

<p>But she had given her promise: perhaps, as Jane put it, she could
not do otherwise. And on the morning after the wedding she went
over to Timberdale. I was sliding in the Ravine&mdash;for there was ice
still in that covered spot, though the frost had nearly disappeared
elsewhere&mdash;when I saw Mrs. Coney come down the zigzag by the help
of her umbrella, and her everyday brown silk gown on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you here, Johnny! Shall I be able to get along?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I help you, you will, Mrs. Coney.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care. I had no idea it would be slippery here. But it is a
long way round to walk by the road, and the master has taken out the
pony-chaise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What wind is blowing you to Timberdale to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An errand that I&rsquo;m not at all pleased to go upon, Johnny; only
Jane made a fuss about it before leaving yesterday. If I told the
master he would be in a fine way. I am going to see the woman that
you boys found in the shed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancied Jane seemed to think a good deal about her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jane did think a good deal about her,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Coney.
&ldquo;She has not had the experience of this sort of people that I have,
Johnny; and girls&rsquo; sympathies are so easily aroused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a romance about it, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Romance, indeed!&rdquo; wrathfully cried Mrs. Coney. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what
leads girls&rsquo; heads away: I wish they&rsquo;d think of good plain sense
instead. It was nothing but romance that led poor Lucy Ashton to
marry that awful man, Bird.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why does Lucy not leave him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s easier to talk about leaving a man than to do it, once he&rsquo;s
your husband. You don&rsquo;t understand it yet, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And shall not, I suppose, until I am married myself. But Lucy
has never talked of leaving Bird.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t leave him. Robert has offered her&mdash;&mdash; Goodness me,
Johnny, don&rsquo;t hurry along like that! It&rsquo;s nothing but ice here. If I
were to get a tumble, I might be lamed for life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Mrs. Coney! It would be only a Christmas gambol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well to laugh, Johnny. Christmas gambols mean fun
to you young fellows with your supple limbs; but to us fifty-year-old
people they may be something else. I wish I had tied some list round
my boots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We left the ice in the Ravine, and she came up the zigzag path
easily to the smooth road. I offered to take the umbrella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Johnny; but I&rsquo;d rather carry it myself. It&rsquo;s my best
silk one, and you might break it. I never dare trust my umbrellas to
Tom: he drives them straight out against trees and posts, and snaps
the sticks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned into Timberdale Court, and asked to see Mrs. Broom.
Mrs. Broom appeared in the parlour with her sleeves turned up to the
elbow, and her hands floury. She had been housekeeper during old
Mr. Ashton&rsquo;s time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Coney, dropping her voice a little: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
come to ask a word or two about that woman&mdash;from the shed, you
know. Who is she?&mdash;and what is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the dropping of Mrs. Coney&rsquo;s voice was as nothing to the
dropping of the housekeeper&rsquo;s face. The questions put her out
uncommonly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to my very heart, ma&rsquo;am, that the woman&mdash;she&rsquo;s but a poor
young thing at best!&mdash;had chosen any part to fall ill in but this! It&rsquo;s
like a Fate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like a what?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Coney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so it is. A Fate for this house. &rsquo;Tis nothing less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what do you mean, Broom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mother Broom bent her head forward, and said a word or two in
Mrs. Coney&rsquo;s ear. Louder, I suppose, than she thought for, if she had
intended me not to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raves about Captain Bird!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Coney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is all her talk, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;George Bird. And considering that
George Bird, blackleg though he has turned out to be, married the
young lady of this house, Miss Lucy Ashton, why, it goes against the
grain for me to hear it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Coney sat down in a sort of bewilderment, and gave me the
silk umbrella. Folding her hands, she stared at Mother Broom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems as though we were always hearing fresh news about that
man, Broom; each time it is something worse than the last. If he
took all the young women within his reach, and&mdash;and&mdash;cut their heads
off, it would be only like him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;George!&rsquo; she moans out in her sleep. That is, in her dreaming,
or her fever, or whatever it is. &lsquo;George, you ought not to have left
me; you should have taken care of me.&rsquo; And then, ma&rsquo;am, she&rsquo;ll be
quiet a bit, save for turning her head about; and begin again,
&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s my baby? where&rsquo;s my baby?&rsquo; Goodness knows &rsquo;twould be
sad enough to hear her if it was anybody&rsquo;s name but Bird&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There might be worse names than his, in the matter of giving us
pain,&rdquo; spoke Mrs. Coney. &ldquo;As to poor Lucy&mdash;it is only another cross
in her sad life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not told this to anybody,&rdquo; went on Mother Broom. &ldquo;Jael
Batty&rsquo;s three parts deaf, as the parish knows, and may not have caught
Bird&rsquo;s name. It will vex my master frightfully for Miss Lucy&rsquo;s sake.
The baby is to be buried to-day. Mr. Charles has stayed to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Coney, and got up, for the baby
appeared to be a sore subject with her. &ldquo;I suppose the girl was coming
across the country in search of Bird?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Broom tossed her head. &ldquo;Whether she was or not, it&rsquo;s an odd
thing that this house should be the one to have to succour her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going,&rdquo; said Mrs. Coney, &ldquo;and I half wish I had never come
in. Broom, I am sorry to have hindered you. You are busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am making my raised pies,&rdquo; said Broom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the second batch.
What with master&rsquo;s coming marriage, and one thing and another, I did
not get &rsquo;em done before the new year. Your Molly says hers beat
mine, Master Ludlow; but I don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She does, does she! It&rsquo;s just like her boasting. Mrs. Todhetley
often makes the pork-pies herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said Mrs. Coney, as we went along, she in deep thought:
&ldquo;that poor Lucy Bird might keep a stick for cutting notches&mdash;as it is
said some prisoners used to do, to mark their days&mdash;and notch off her
dreadful cares, that are ever recurring. Why, Johnny, what&rsquo;s that
crowd for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The church stood on the right between Timberdale Court and the
village. A regular mob of children seemed to be pressing round the
gate of the churchyard. I went to look, leaving Mrs. Coney standing.</p>

<p>Charles Ashton was coming out of the church in his surplice, and
the clerk, old Sam Mullet, behind him, carrying a little coffin. The
grave was in the corner of the burial-ground, and Mr. Ashton went
straight to it, and continued the service begun in the church. If it had
been a lord&rsquo;s child, he could not have done it all in better order.</p>

<p>But there were no mourners, unless old Mullet could be called one.
He put the coffin on the grass, and was in a frightful temper. I took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
off my hat and waited: it would have looked so to run away when
there was no one else to stand there: and Mrs. Coney&rsquo;s face, as cross
as old Mullet&rsquo;s, might be seen peering through the hedge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s come to a pretty pass, when tramps&rsquo; brats have to be put in
the ground like honest folks&rsquo;s,&rdquo; grunted Sam, when Mr. Ashton had
walked away, and he began to fling in the spadefuls of earth. &ldquo;What
must he needs go and baptize that there young atom for?&mdash;he ain&rsquo;t
our parson; he don&rsquo;t belong to we in this parish. I dun-no what the
world be a-coming to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Ashton was talking to Mrs. Coney when I got up. I told him
what a way Sam Mullet was in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I believe what I did has not given satisfaction in
all quarters; so I waited to take the service myself, and save other
people trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In what name is the dead child registered, Charles?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Coney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucy Bird.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucy Bird! <em>Bird?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the name the mother gave me in one of her lucid intervals,&rdquo;
answered the clergyman, shortly.</p>

<p>He hastened away, saying he must catch a train, for that his own
parish was wanting him; but I fancied he did not care to be further
questioned. Mrs. Coney stood still to stare after him, and would have
liked to ask him how much and how little he knew.</p>

<p>Lucy Bird! It did sound strange to hear the name&mdash;as if it were
the real Lucy Bird we knew so well. I said so to Mrs. Coney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The impudence of the woman must pass all belief,&rdquo; she muttered to
herself. &ldquo;Let us get on, Johnny? I would rather run a mile any
other way than go to see her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaving me on the wooden bench outside Jael Batty&rsquo;s door, she
went in. It was remarkably lively: the farrier&rsquo;s shop opposite to look
at, five hay-ricks, and a heap of children who strolled after us from the
churchyard, and stayed to stare at me. Mrs. Coney came out again
soon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s of no use my remaining, Johnny. She can&rsquo;t understand a word
said to her, only lies there rambling, and asking people to bring her
baby. If she had any sense left in her, she might just go down on her
knees in thankfulness that it&rsquo;s gone. Jael Batty says she has done
nothing else but wail for it all the blessed morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is only natural she should.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Natural! Natural to mourn for that baby! Don&rsquo;t you say stupid
things, Johnny. It&rsquo;s a great mercy that it has been taken; and you
must know that as well as any one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say it isn&rsquo;t; babies must make no end of noise and work;
but you see mothers care for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a simpleton, Johnny. If you take to upholding tramps
and infants dying in sheds, goodness knows what you&rsquo;ll come to in
time.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>At the end of a fortnight, Ashton of Timberdale and his wife came
home. It was a fine afternoon in the middle of January, but getting
dusk, and a lot of us had gone over to the Court to see them arrive.
Jane looked as happy as a queen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; she whispered, whilst we were standing to take some tea
that Mother Broom (with a white cockade in her cap) brought in upon
a silver tray, &ldquo;how about that poor woman? She is not dead, I
hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told Jane that she was better. The fever had gone down, but she
was so weak and reduced that the doctor had not allowed her to be
questioned. We knew no more of who she was than we had known
before. Mrs. Coney overheard what I was saying, and took Jane
aside.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a bit of a battle: Mrs. Coney remonstrating
with a severe face, Jane holding out and flushing a little. She was
telling Jane not to go to Jael Batty&rsquo;s, and representing why she ought
not to go. Jane said she must go&mdash;her heart was set upon it: and
began to re-tie her bonnet-strings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother dear, don&rsquo;t be angry with me in this the first hour of entering
on my new home&mdash;it would seem like a bad omen for me. You
don&rsquo;t know how strongly I have grown to think that my duty lies in
seeing this poor woman, in comforting her if I can. It cannot hurt
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose Robert would say? It is to him you owe
obedience now, Jane, not to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To him first, and to you next, my mother; and I trust I shall ever
yield it to you both. But Robert is quite willing that I should go: he
knows all I think about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jane, I wouldn&rsquo;t have said a word against it; indeed I had made up
my mind that it was a good wish on your part; but now that we have
discovered she is in some way connected with&mdash;with the Birds&mdash;why,
I don&rsquo;t think Robert will like you to meddle with it. I&rsquo;m sure I shrink
from telling him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane Coney&mdash;Ashton I mean: one can&rsquo;t get out of old names all at
once&mdash;looked down in distress, thinking of the pain it would cause
her husband for his sister&rsquo;s sake. Then she took her mother&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell Robert what you have told me, mamma. He will still let me
go, I think; for he knows how much I wish it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had their conference away from us; Mrs. Coney, Robert
Ashton, and Jane. Of course he was frightfully put out; but Jane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
was right&mdash;he said she should go all the same. Mrs. Coney shut her
lips tight, and made no further comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promised her, you see, Mrs. Coney,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;She has an idea
in her head that&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure I scarcely know what it is, except that her
going is connected with Gratitude and Duty, and&mdash;and Heaven&rsquo;s blessing.
Why, do you know we might have stayed away another week,
but for this? I could have spared it; but she would come home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never knew Jane take a thing up like this before,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Coney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any way, I suppose it is I who shall have to deal with it&mdash;for the
sake of keeping it from Lucy,&rdquo; was Robert&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;I wish with all
my heart Bird had been at the bottom of the sea before his ill-omened
steps brought him to Timberdale! There&rsquo;s not, as I believe, another
such scamp in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane waited for nothing else. Shielded by the dusk of the evening,
she went hastening to Jael Batty&rsquo;s and back again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down for her presently,&rdquo; said Robert. But she was back
again before he started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came back at once to set the misapprehension right,&rdquo; said Jane,
her eyes bright with eagerness, her cheeks glowing. &ldquo;Mother dear&mdash;Robert&mdash;Johnny&mdash;listen,
all of you: that poor sick woman is George
Bird&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jane!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed she is. Captain Bird used to talk to Lucy of his little sister
Clara&mdash;I have heard you say so, Robert&mdash;in the old days when he first
came here. It is she who is lying at Jael Batty&rsquo;s&mdash;Clara Bird.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The company sat down like so many lambs, Mrs. Coney&rsquo;s mouth
and eyes alike opening. It sounded wonderful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;Jane, child&mdash;there was still the baby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; replied Jane, in an uncomfortable hurry.
&ldquo;I did not like to ask her about that, she cries so. But she is Clara
Bird; Captain Bird&rsquo;s sister, and Lucy&rsquo;s too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Coney, rubbing her face. &ldquo;Poor misguided
young thing&mdash;left to the guardianship of such a man as that, he
let her go her own way, no doubt. This accounts for what Broom
heard her say in the fever&mdash;&lsquo;George, you should have taken care
of me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she being taken care of now in her sickness, down at Jael
Batty&rsquo;s?&rdquo; spoke up Robert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. For Jael, though three-parts deaf, is a kind and excellent
nurse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert Ashton wrote that night to Worcester; a sharp letter; bidding
Captain Bird come over and see to his sister. The poor thing took to
Jane wonderfully, and told her more than she&rsquo;d have told any one else.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am twenty,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and George is six-and-thirty; there is all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
that difference between us. Our father and mother were dead, and I
lived with my aunt in Gloucestershire: where George lived, I did not
know. He had been adopted by a wealthy relative in London, and
went into the army. My mother had been a lady, but married beneath
her, and it was her family who took to George and brought him up a
gentleman. Mine was a hard, dull life. My aunt&mdash;she was my father&rsquo;s
sister&mdash;counted ever-so-many children, and I had to nurse and see to
them. Her husband was a master plumber and glazier. One day&mdash;it
is fifteen months ago now&mdash;I shall never forget it&mdash;my brother George
arrived. I did not know him: I had not seen him since I was thirteen,
and then he was a fine handsome gentleman in an officer&rsquo;s regimentals.
He was rather shabby now, and he had come to see if he could borrow
money, but my aunt&rsquo;s husband would not lend him any; he told him
he had much ado to keep his own family. I cried a good deal, and
George said he would take me to London to his wife. I think he did
it to spite them, because of their not lending the money, as much as to
please me&mdash;he saw that I should be a loss there. We went up&mdash;and
oh how nice I thought his wife! She was a kind, gentle lady, formerly
Miss Lucy Ashton; but nearly always ailing, and afraid of George.
George had gay acquaintances, men and women, and he let me go to
theatres and balls with them. Lucy said it was wrong, that they were
not nice friends for me; but I grew to like the gaiety, and she could
do nothing. One night, upon going home from church, I found both
George and Lucy gone from the lodgings. I had been spending the
Sunday with some people they knew, the quietest of all their friends.
There lay a note on the table from Lucy, saying they were obliged to
leave London unexpectedly, and begging me to go at once&mdash;on the
morrow&mdash;back to Gloucestershire, for which she enclosed a sovereign.
I did not go: one invited me, and another invited me, and it was two
months, good, before I went down. Ah me! I heard no more of
George; he had got into some trouble in London, and was afraid to let
it be known where he was. I have never heard of him or his wife to
this hour. My aunt was glad to see me for the help I should be to
her; but I felt ill always and could not do so much as I used. I didn&rsquo;t
know what ailed me; I didn&rsquo;t indeed; I did not think it could be
much; and then, when the time went on and it all happened, and they
knew, and I knew, I came away with the baby because of the reproach
and the shame. But George ought not to have left me to myself in
London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when Jane Ashton repeated all this to Robert, he said Bird
deserved to be hanged and quartered.</p>

<p>There came no answer from Captain Bird. Perhaps Ashton of
Timberdale did not really expect any would come.</p>

<p>But on the Sunday afternoon, from the train that passed Timberdale
from Worcester about the time folks came out of church, there descended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
a poor, weak woman (looking like a girl too) in a worn shawl that was
too thin for the weather. She waited until the roads should be clear,
as if not wanting to be seen, and then wrapped the shawl close around
her arms and went out with her black veil down. It was Lucy Bird.
And she was so pretty still, in spite of the wan thin cheeks and the
faded clothes! There were two ways of getting to Jael Batty&rsquo;s from
the station. She took the long and obscure one, and in turning the
corner of the lane between the church and Timberdale Court, she met
Robert Ashton.</p>

<p>But for her own movement, he might never have noticed her. It
was growing dusk; and when she saw him coming, she turned sharp
off to a stile and stood as if looking for something in the field. There&rsquo;s
not much to stare at in a ploughed field at dusk, as Ashton of Timberdale
knew, and he naturally looked at the person who had gone so fast
to do it. Something in the cut of the shoulders struck him as being
familiar, and he stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucy! Is it you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course it was no use her saying it was not. She burst into tears,
trembling and shaking. Robert passed round her his good strong arm.
He guessed what had brought her to Timberdale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucy, my dear, have you come over from Worcester?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;I shall be better in a minute, Robert. I am
a little tired, and the train shook me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have sent me word, and I would have had a fly at the
station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sent him word! It was good of Robert to pretend to say that; but
he knew that she wouldn&rsquo;t have presumed to do it. It was that feeling
on Lucy&rsquo;s part that vexed him so much. Since Bird had turned out
the villain that he had, Lucy acted, even to her own family, as though
she had lost caste, identifying herself with her husband, and humbling
herself to them. What though she was part and parcel with the
fellow, as Robert said, she was not responsible for his ill-doings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lean on me, Lucy. You must have a good rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that way,&rdquo; she said at the bottom of the lane, as he was turning
to the Court. &ldquo;I am going to Jael Batty&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you have had some rest and refreshment at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot go to your home, Robert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed but you can; and will,&rdquo; he answered, leading her on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather not. Your wife may not care to receive me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and try her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Robert, I am not fit to see any one: I am not indeed. My spirits
are low now, and I often burst into tears for nothing. I have been
praying, all the way over, not to meet you. After what was done to
you at our house but a week or two ago, I did not expect ever to have
been noticed by you again. Jane must hate me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Does she! Jane and I have been concocting a charming little plot
about you, Lucy. We are going to have your old room made ready,
and the sweet-scented lavender sheets put on the bed, and get you
over to us. For good, if you will stop; long enough to recruit your
health if you will not. Don&rsquo;t you remember how you used to talk in
the holidays about the home sheets; saying you only got them smelling
of soap at school?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A faint smile, like a shade, flitted over Lucy Bird&rsquo;s face at the
reminiscence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should not know the feel of fine white linen sheets now: coarse
calico ones have had to content me this many a day. Let me turn,
Robert! For my own sake, I would rather not meet your wife. You
cannot know how I feel about seeing old friends; those who&mdash;who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those who once knew me, she meant to say; but broke down with
a sob. Robert kept walking on. Lucy was a great deal younger than
he, and had been used to yield to him from the time she was a child.
Well for her would it have been, that she had yielded to his opinion
when Captain Bird came a-courting to Timberdale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have company at your house, perhaps, Robert?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a soul but Jane and me. The Coneys asked us to dine
there to-day, but we thought we&rsquo;d have the first Sunday to ourselves.
We went to church this morning; and I came out after dinner to ask
after old Arkwright: they fear he is dying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made no further opposition, and Robert took her into the Court,
to the warm dining-room. Jane was not there. Robert put her into
the arm-chair that used to be their father&rsquo;s, and brought her a glass of
wine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; she faintly said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must take it, Lucy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid. My head is weak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sign you want something good to strengthen it,&rdquo; he urged; and
she drank the wine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now take off your bonnet, Lucy, and make yourself at home,
whilst I go to seek Jane,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucy is here,&rdquo; he whispered, when he had found his wife. &ldquo;The
merest shadow you ever saw. A wan, faded thing that one&rsquo;s heart
bleeds to look upon. We must try and keep her for a bit, Jane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Robert, if we can! And nurse her into health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And deliver her from that brute she calls husband&mdash;as I should
prefer to put it, Jane. Her life with him must be something woeful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they got in, she was leaning forward in the chair, crying
silently. In the clear old room, with all its familiar features about her,
memory could only have its most painful sway. Her grand old father
with his grand old white hair used to sit where she was sitting; her
brothers had each his appointed place; and she was a lovely bright child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
amongst them, petted by all; the sentimental girl with her head as
brimful of romance as ever the other Lucy Ashton&rsquo;s had been, when she
went out to her trysts with the Master of Ravenswood. Which had
been the more bitter fate in after-life&mdash;that Lucy&rsquo;s or this one&rsquo;s?</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton went quietly up, put her arms round Lucy, and kissed
her many times. She untied the bonnet, which Lucy had not done,
and gave it with the shawl to Robert, standing behind. The bright hair
fell down in a shower&mdash;the bonnet had caught it&mdash;and she put her
feeble hand up as if to feel the extent of the disaster. It made her
look so like the sweet young sister they had all prized, that Robert
turned to the window and gave a few stamps, as if his boots were cold.</p>

<p>How she cried!&mdash;tears that came from the very heart. Putting her
face down on the arm of the chair, she let her grief have its way.
Jane held her hand and stroked it lovingly. Robert felt inclined to dash
his arms through the dark window-panes on which the fire-light played,
in imaginary chastisement of the scamp, Bird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you lend me a shawl of your own, Jane?&rdquo; she asked, by-and-by,
when Robert said they would have tea in&mdash;and she glanced
down at her shabby brown gown. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish the servants to see
me like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane flew out and brought one. A handsome cashmere of scarlet
and gold-colour, that her mother had given her before the wedding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just for an hour or two, until I leave,&rdquo; said Lucy, as she covered
herself up in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not go out of this house to-night, Lucy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must, Robert. You can guess who it was I came to Timberdale
to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I can. She is going on all right and getting stronger;
so there&rsquo;s no immediate haste about that. Mr. Bird would not&mdash;not
come, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucy did not answer. Robert was right&mdash;Bird would not come: his
young sister might die where she was or be sheltered in the workhouse,
for all the concern he gave himself. For one thing, the man was at
his wits&rsquo; end for money, and not too sure of his own liberty. But Lucy&rsquo;s
conscience had not let her be still: as soon as she had scraped together
the means for a third-class ticket, she came over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor girl has lain like a weight upon my mind, since the time
when we abandoned her in London,&rdquo; confessed Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you abandon her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not my fault,&rdquo; murmured Lucy; and Robert felt vexed to
have asked the hasty question. &ldquo;I hoped she went home, as I desired
her; but I did not feel sure of it, for Clara was thoughtless. And those
unsuspicious country girls cannot take care of themselves too well.
Robert, whatever has happened I regard as our fault,&rdquo; she added,
looking up at him with some fever in her eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As Mr. Bird&rsquo;s fault; not yours,&rdquo; corrected Robert&mdash;who, strange
perhaps to say, observed courtesy of speech towards Bird when talking
with Lucy: giving him in general a handle to his name. It might
have sounded ironical, but that he couldn&rsquo;t help. &ldquo;Did you never
write to ascertain what had become of her, Lucy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My husband would not let me. He is often in difficulties: and we
never have a settled home, or address. What will be done with her,
Robert?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She will stay where she is until she is strong; Jane wishes it; and
then we shall see about the future. Something will turn up for her in
some place or other, I&rsquo;ve little doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jane glanced at her husband and smiled. Robert had given her
a promise to help the girl to an honest living. But, as he frankly told
his wife, had he known it was a sister of Bird&rsquo;s, he might never have
done so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About yourself, Lucy; that may be the better theme to talk of just
now,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;Will you remain here for good in your old
home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hot tears rushed to her eyes, the hot flush to her cheeks. She
looked deprecatingly at both, as if craving pardon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot. You know I cannot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell you what Bird is, Lucy? And what he most likely
will be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To what end, Robert?&rdquo; she faintly asked. &ldquo;I know it without.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you ought to leave him&mdash;for your own sake. Leave him
before you are compelled to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not before, Robert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Robert, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; she answered, breaking down. &ldquo;He
is my husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And nothing else could they get from her. Though she cried and
sobbed, and did not deny that her life was a fear and a misery, yet she
would go back to him; go back on the morrow; it was her duty. In
the moment&rsquo;s anger Robert Ashton said he would wash his hands of her
as well as of Bird. But Jane and Lucy knew better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can have induced you and Robert to take up this poor Clara
in the way you are doing&mdash;and mean to do?&rdquo; she asked when she was
alone with Jane at the close of the evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;owe a debt of gratitude; and I thought I could best pay it in
this way,&rdquo; was Mrs. Ashton&rsquo;s timid and rather unwilling answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A debt of gratitude! To Clara?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. To Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><span class="f9">VII.</span><br />

CHARLES VAN RHEYN.</h2>


<p>I shall always say it was a singular thing that I should chance to go
back to school that time the day before the quarter opened. Singular,
because I heard and saw more of the boy I am going to tell of than I
otherwise might have heard and seen. I was present at his arrival;
and I was present at his&mdash;well, let us say, at his departure.</p>

<p>The midsummer holidays were nearly up when Hugh was taken ill.
Duffham was uncertain what the illness was going to be: so he pitched
upon scarlatina. Upon that, the Squire and Mrs. Todhetley packed me
back to school there and then. Not from any fear of my taking it; I
had had it, and Tod too (and both of us were well again, I recollect,
within a week or so); but if once the disease had really shown itself,
Dr. Frost would not have liked us to return lest we might convey it to
the school. Tod was in Gloucestershire. He was written to, and told
not to return home, but to go straight to school.</p>

<p>Dr. Frost was surprised to see me. He said my coming back was
quite right; and I am sure he tried to put me at ease and make me
comfortable. Not a single boy had stayed the holidays that summer,
and the doctor and I were alone. The school would open the following
day, when masters and boys were alike expected to return. I had
dinner with the doctor&mdash;he usually dined late during the holidays&mdash;and
we played at chess afterwards.</p>

<p>Breakfast was just over the next morning when the letters came in.
Amongst them was one from France, bearing the Rouen post-mark.
Now the doctor, learned man though he was in classics and what not,
could make nothing of French. Carrying the letter to the window,
turning its pages over and back again, and staring at it through his
spectacles, he at last brought it to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a pretty good French scholar, Johnny; can you read this?
I can&rsquo;t, I confess. But the paper&rsquo;s so thin, and the ink so pale, and the
writing so small, I could scarcely see it if it were English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I had to go over it twice before I could make it out. As he
said, the ink was pale, and it was a frightfully small and cramped
handwriting. The letter was dated Rouen, and was signed curtly,
&ldquo;Van Rheyn,&rdquo; French fashion, without the writer&rsquo;s Christian name.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Monsieur Van Rheyn wrote to say that he was about to consign his
son, Charles Aberleigh Van Rheyn, to Dr. Frost&rsquo;s care, and that he
would arrive quickly after the letter, having already departed on his
journey under the charge of a &ldquo;gentilhomme Anglais.&rdquo; It added that
the son would bring credentials with him; that he spoke English, and
was of partly English descent, through his mother, the late Madame
Van Rheyn, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">née</i> Aberleigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather a summary way of consigning a pupil to my charge,&rdquo;
remarked Dr. Frost. &ldquo;Aberleigh?&mdash;Aberleigh?&rdquo; he continued, as if
trying to recollect something, and bending his spectacles over the
letter. &ldquo;She must have been one of the Aberleighs of Upton, I
should think. Perhaps Hall knows? I have heard her mention the
Aberleighs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ringing the bell, the housekeeper was sent for. Dr. Frost asked her
what she knew of the Aberleighs of Upton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s none of them left now to know, sir,&rdquo; answered Hall.
&ldquo;There never was but two&mdash;after the old mother died: Miss Aberleigh
and Miss Emma Aberleigh. Good fortunes the young ladies had, sir,
and both of them, I remember, married on the same day. Miss Aberleigh
to Captain Scott, and Miss Emma to a French gentleman, Mosseer
Van Rheyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think, by the name, he was Dutch&mdash;or Flemish; not
French,&rdquo; remarked the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway, sir, he was said to be French,&rdquo; returned Hall. &ldquo;A dark
sallow gentleman who wore a braided coat. The young ladies never
came back to their home after the wedding-day, and the place was sold.
Captain Scott sailed with his wife for Injee, and Mosseer Van Rheyn
took Miss Emma off to his house in France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you recollect where his home was? In what part of France?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. And if I did, I should never be able to speak the name.
Not long ago I heard it said that poor Miss Emma was dead&mdash;Mrs.
Van Rheyn that is. A nice quiet girl, she was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I conclude the new pupil spoken of to me, must be the son
of Monsieur Van Rheyn and Miss Emma Aberleigh,&rdquo; remarked the
doctor, when Hall was dismissed. &ldquo;You must help to make things
pleasant for him, Johnny: it will be a change at first from his own
home and country. Do you remember that other French boy we had
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did. And the remembrance made me laugh. He used to lament
every day that he had not a plate of soup for dinner, and to say the
meat was tough.</p>

<p>Strolling out at the front iron gates in the course of the morning,
wondering how long the boys were going to be before some of them
put in an appearance, I caught sight of the first. He was walking up
from the Plough and Harrow Inn, and must have come by the omnibus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
that plied backwards and forwards between the inn and the station.
The Plough and Harrow man-of-all-work followed behind, carrying a
large trunk.</p>

<p>Of all queer figures that boy looked the queerest. I wondered who
he was, and whether he could really be coming as a pupil. His
trousers and vest were nankeen, his coat was a sort of open blouse, and
flew out behind him; the hat he wore was a tall chimney-pot with a
wide brim. Off went the hat with a bow and a flourish of the arm, as
he reached me and the gates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ask your pardon, sir. This is, I believe, the pension of Dr.
Frost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The French accent, though that was slight, the French manners,
the French turn of the words, told me who it was. For a minute
or two I really could not answer for staring at him. He seemed to
have arrived with a shaved head, as if just out of gaol, or of brain-fever.</p>

<p>The hair was cut as closely as it could be cut, short of shaving: his
face was red and round and covered with freckles: you could not have
put a pin&rsquo;s point between them. Really and truly it was the most
remarkable figure ever seen out of a picture. I could not guess his age
exactly: something perhaps between twelve and fourteen. He was
slender and upright, and to all appearance strong.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you must be Charles Van Rheyn,&rdquo; I said then, holding out
my hand to welcome him. &ldquo;Dr. Frost is expecting you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put his hand into mine after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, not seeming
quite to understand that he might: but such a brightness came into his
rather large and honest grey eyes, that I liked him from that hour, in
spite of the clothes and the freckles and the shorn head. He had
crossed to Folkestone by the night boat, he said, had come on to
London, and the gentleman, who was his escort so far, had there put
him into an early train to come on to his destination.</p>

<p>Dr. Frost was at the window, and came to the door. Van Rheyn
stood still when within a yard of him, took his hat off with the most
respectful air, and bowed his head half-way to the ground. He had
evidently been brought up with a reverence for pastors and masters.
The doctor shook hands. The first thing Van Rheyn did on entering
the reception-parlour, was to produce from some inner pocket a large,
square letter, sealed with two flaming red seals and a coat of arms;
which he handed to the doctor. It contained a draft for a good sum
of money in advance of the first three months&rsquo; payment, and some
pages of closely-written matter in the crabbed hand of Monsieur Van
Rheyn. Dr. Frost put the pages aside to await the arrival of the
French master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father was unable to remit the exact amount of money for the
trimestre, sir, not knowing what it would be,&rdquo; said young Van Rheyn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
&ldquo;And there will be the extra expenses besides. He will arrange that
with you later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The end of the term would have been time enough to remit this,&rdquo;
said the doctor, smiling. &ldquo;It is not our custom to receive payment in
advance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the custom in France, sir, I assure you. And, besides, I am
to you a stranger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not altogether a stranger; I believe I know something of your
mother&rsquo;s family,&rdquo; said Dr. Frost. &ldquo;How came your father to fix upon
my school for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother knew of your school, sir: she and my father used to
talk of placing me at it. And an English gentleman who came lately
to Rouen spoke of it&mdash;he said he knew you very well. That again put
into my father&rsquo;s head to send me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the same Van Rheyn that they had thought&mdash;the son of Miss
Emma Aberleigh. She had been dead two years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you a Protestant or a Roman Catholic?&rdquo; questioned Dr.
Frost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Protestant, sir: the same that my mother was. We attended
the église of Monsieur le Pasteur Mons, of the Culte Evangélique.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor asked him if he would take anything before dinner, and
he chose a glass of eau sucrée. The mal-de-mer had been rather bad,
he said, and he had not been able to eat since.</p>

<p>Evidently Hall did not approve of eau sucrée. She had never made
eau sucary, she said, when sent to for it. Bringing in the water and
sugar, she stood by to watch Van Rheyn mix it, her face sour, her lips
drawn in. I am sure it gave her pleasure, when he asked for a few
drops of orange-flower water, to be able to say there was not such a
thing in the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This young gentleman is the son of the Miss Emma Aberleigh you
once knew, Hall,&rdquo; spoke the doctor, with a view no doubt to putting
her on good terms with the new pupil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she answered crustily. &ldquo;He favours his mamma about
the eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must have had very nice eyes,&rdquo; I put in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so she had,&rdquo; said Van Rheyn, looking at me gratefully.
&ldquo;Thank you for saying so. I wish you could have known her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And might I ask, sir, what has become of the other Miss Aberleigh?&rdquo;
asked Hall of Van Rheyn. &ldquo;The young lady who went off to
Injee with her husband on the wedding-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would say my Aunt Margaret,&rdquo; he rejoined. &ldquo;She is quite
well. She and the major and the children will make the voyage to
Europe next year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the eau sucrée came to an end, the doctor turned him over to
me, telling me to take care of him till dinner-time, which that day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
would be early. Van Rheyn said he should like to unpack his box,
and we went upstairs together. Growing confidential over the unpacking,
he gave me scraps of information touching his home and
family, the mention of one item leading to another.</p>

<p>His baptismal name in full, he said, was Charles Jean Aberleigh; his
father&rsquo;s was Jean Marie. Their home was a très joli château close to
Rouen: in five minutes you could walk there. It was all much
changed since his mother died (he seemed to have loved her with a
fervent love and to revere her memory); the last thing he did on
coming away for England was to take some flowers to her grave. It
was thought in Rouen that his father was going to make a second
marriage with one of the Demoiselles de Tocqueville, whom his Aunt
Claribelle did not like. His Aunt Claribelle, his father&rsquo;s sister, had
come to live at the château when his mother died; but if that Thérèsine
de Tocqueville came into the house she would quit it. The Demoiselles
de Tocqueville had hardly any <em>dot</em>,&mdash;which would be much against the
marriage, Aunt Claribelle thought, and bad for his father; because
when he, Charles, should be the age of twenty-one, the money came
to him; it had been his mother&rsquo;s, and was so settled: and his father&rsquo;s
own property was but small. Of course he should wish his father to
keep always as much as he pleased, but Aunt Claribelle thought the
English trustees would not allow that. Aunt Claribelle&rsquo;s opinion was,
that his father had at length decided to send him to a pension in
England while he made the marriage; but he (Charles) knew that his
mother had wished him to finish his education in England, and to go to
one of the two colleges to which English gentlemen went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes old Fontaine,&rdquo; I interrupted at this juncture, seeing
his arrival from the window.</p>

<p>Van Rheyn looked up from his shirts, which he was counting. He
seemed to have the tidiest ways in the world. &ldquo;Who is it that you
say? Fontaine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Fontaine, the French master. You can talk away with
him in your native tongue as much as you like, Van Rheyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have come here to speak the English tongue, not the
French,&rdquo; debated he, looking at me seriously. &ldquo;My father wishes me
to speak and read it without any accent; and I wish it also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak it very well already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you can hear that it is not my native tongue&mdash;that I am a
foreigner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I must learn to speak it without that&mdash;as the English do. It
will be necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I supposed he might allude to his future life. &ldquo;What are you to be,
Van Rheyn?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What profession, do you ask? I need not be any: I have enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
fortune to be a rentier&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what you call that in English;
it means a gentleman who lives on his money. But I wish, myself, to
be an English priest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An English priest! Do you mean a parson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I mean that. So you see I must learn the English tongue.
My mother used to talk to me about the priests in her land&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Parsons, Van Rheyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon: I forget. And I fear I have caught up the
French names for things since my mother died. It was neither priest
nor parson she used to call the English ministers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clergymen, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was it. She said the clergymen were good men, and she
should like me to be one. In winter, when it was cold, and she had
some fire in her chamber, I used to sit up there with her, after coming
home from classe, and we talked together, our two selves. I should
have much money, she said, when I grew to be a man, and could lead
an idle life. But she would not like that: she wanted me to be a good
man, and to go to heaven when I died, where she would be; and she
thought if I were a clergyman I should have serious thoughts always.
So I wish to be a clergyman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said all this with the utmost simplicity and composure, just as he
might have spoken of going for a ride. There could be no mistaking
that he was of a thoroughly straightforward and simple-minded nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might involve your living over here, Van Rheyn: once you were
in Orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. Papa would not mind. England was mamma&rsquo;s
country, and she loved it. There was more peace in England than in
France, she thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, she must have been a good mother, Van Rheyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a moment his grey eyes were shining at me through a mist of
tears. &ldquo;Oh, she was so good, so good! You can never know. If she
had lived I should never have had sorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did she die of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I cannot tell. She was well in the morning, and she was dead
at night. Not that she was strong ever. It was one Dimanche. We
had been to the office, she and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What office?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, pardon&mdash;I forget I am speaking English. I mean to church.
Monsieur Mons had preached; and we were walking along the street
towards home afterwards, mamma talking to me about the sermon,
which had been a very holy one, when we met the Aunt Claribelle,
who had come into the town for high mass at St. Ouen. Mamma
asked her to come home and dine with us; and she said yes, but she
must first go to say bon-jour to old Madame Soubitez. As she parted
from us, there was suddenly a great outcry. It was fête at Rouen that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Sunday. Some bands of music were to play on the estrade in the
public garden, competing for a prize, consequently the streets were
crowded. We looked back at the noise, and saw many horses, without
riders, galloping along towards us; men were running after them,
shouting and calling; and the people, mad with fright, tumbled over
one another in the effort to get away. Later, we heard that these
horses, frightened by something, had broken out of an hotel post-yard.
Well, mamma gave just a cry of fear and held my hand tighter, as we
set off to run with the rest, the horses stamping wildly after us. But
the people pushed between us, and I lost her. She was at home before
me, and was sitting at the side of the fountain, inside the château
entrance-gate, when I got up, her face all white and blue, and her neck
and throat beating, as she clung to the nearest lion with both hands.
It alarmed me more than the horses had, for I had never seen her look
so. &lsquo;Come in, mamma,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;and take a little glass of cordial;&rsquo; but
she could not answer me, she did not stir. I called one of the servants,
and by-and-by she got a little breath again, and went into the house,
leaning upon both of us, and so up to her chamber. Quite immediately
papa came home: he always went into town to his club on the Sunday
mornings, and he ran for Monsieur Petit, the médecin&mdash;the doctor. By
seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, mamma was dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! What was the cause?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa did not tell me. He and Monsieur Petit talked about the
heart: they said it was feeble. Oh, how we cried, papa and I! He
cried for many days. I hope he will not bring home Thérèsine de
Tocqueville!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dinner-bell rang out, and we went down. Dr. Frost was putting
up the letter which old Fontaine had been translating to him. It was
full of directions about Van Rheyn&rsquo;s health. What he was to do, and
what not to do. Monsieur Van Rheyn said his son was not strong: he
was not to be allowed to do gymnastics or &ldquo;boxing,&rdquo; or to play at
rough games, or take violent exercise of any kind; and a small glass
of milk was to be given him at night when he went to bed. If the
clothes sent over with him were not suitable to the school, or in accordance
with the English mode, Dr. Frost was prayed to be at the trouble
of procuring him new ones. He was to be brought well on in all the
studies necessary to constitute the &ldquo;gentilhomme,&rdquo; and especially in
the speaking and reading of English.</p>

<p>Dr. Frost directed his spectacles to Charles Van Rheyn, examining
him from top to toe. The round, red face, and the strongly-built frame
appeared to give nothing but indications of robust health. The doctor
questioned him in what way he was not strong&mdash;whether he was subject
to a cough, or to want of appetite, and other such items. But Van
Rheyn seemed to know nothing about it, and said he had always been
quite well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The father fears we should make him into a muscular Englishman,
hence these restrictions,&rdquo; thought Dr. Frost.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the fellows began to come in thick and threefold:
Tod amongst them, who arrived about tea-time. To describe their
amazement when they saw Van Rheyn is quite beyond me. It seemed
that they never meant to leave off staring. Some of them gave him
a little chaff, even that first night. Van Rheyn was very shy and
silent. Entirely at his ease as he had been with me alone, the numbers
seemed to daunt him; to strike him and his courage into himself.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>On the whole, Van Rheyn was not liked. Once let a school set
itself against a new fellow at first&mdash;and Van Rheyn&rsquo;s queer appearance
had done that much for him&mdash;it takes a long time to bring matters
round&mdash;if they ever are brought round at all. When his hair began to
sprout, it looked exactly like pig&rsquo;s bristles. And that was the first
nickname he got: Bristles. The doctor had soon changed his style of
coat, and he wore jackets, as we did.</p>

<p>Charles Van Rheyn did not seem inclined to grow sociable. Shy
and silent as he had shown himself to them that first evening, so he
remained. True, he had no encouragement to be otherwise. The
boys continually threw ridicule on him, making him into an almost
perpetual butt. Any mistake in the pronunciation of an English word&mdash;Van
Rheyn never made a mistake as to its <em>meaning</em>&mdash;they hissed
and groaned at. I shall never forget one occasion. Being asked when
that Indian lot intended to arrive (meaning the Scotts), and whether
they would make the voyage in a palanquin (for the boys plied him
with questions purposely) he answered, &ldquo;Not in a palanquin, but in a
sheep&rdquo;&mdash;meaning ship. The uproar at that was so loud, that some
of the masters looked in to know what was up.</p>

<p>Van Rheyn, too, was next door to helpless. He did not climb, or
leap, or even run. Had not been used to it, he said. What <em>had</em> he
been used to do, then, he was asked one day. Oh, he had sat out in
the garden with his mother; and since her death, with Aunt Claribelle,
and gone for an airing in the carriage three times a week. Was he a
girl? roared the boys. Did he do patchwork? Not now; he had left off
sewing when he was nine, answered Van Rheyn innocently, unconscious
of the storm of mockery the avowal would invoke. &ldquo;Pray, were you
born a young lady?&mdash;or did they change you at nurse?&rdquo; shouted
Jessup, who would have kept the ball rolling till midnight. &ldquo;I say,
you fellows, he has come to the wrong school: we don&rsquo;t take in girls,
do we? Let me introduce this one to you, boys&mdash;&lsquo;Miss Charlotte.&rsquo;&rdquo;
And, so poor Charley Van Rheyn got that nickname as well as the
other. Miss Charlotte!</p>

<p>Latin was a stumbling-block. Van Rheyn had learnt it according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to French rules and French pronunciation, and he could not readily get
into our English mode. &ldquo;It was bad enough to have to teach a stupid
boy Latin,&rdquo; grumbled the under Latin master (under Dr. Frost), &ldquo;but
worse to have to <em>un</em>-teach him.&rdquo; Van Rheyn was not stupid, however;
if he seemed so, it was because his new life was so strange to
him.</p>

<p>One day the boys dared him to a game at leap-frog. Some of them
were at it in the yard, and Van Rheyn stood by, looking on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go in for it?&rdquo; suddenly asked Parker, giving him
a push. &ldquo;There is to be a round or two at boxing this evening, why
don&rsquo;t you go in for <em>that</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They never would let me do these rough things,&rdquo; replied Van
Rheyn, who invariably answered all the chaffing questions civilly and
patiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t? Who&rsquo;s &lsquo;they&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother and my Aunt Claribelle. Also, when I was starting to
come here, my father said I was not to exert myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Miss Charlotte; but why on earth didn&rsquo;t the respectable
old gentleman send you over in petticoats? Never was such a thing
heard of, you know, as for a girl to wear a coat and pantaloons. It&rsquo;s
not decent, Miss Charlotte; it&rsquo;s not modest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you say all this to me for ever? I am not a girl,&rdquo; said
poor Van Rheyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No? Don&rsquo;t tell fibs. If you were not a girl you&rsquo;d go in for our
games. Come! Try this. Leap-frog&rsquo;s especially edifying, I assure
you: expands the mind. <em>Won&rsquo;t</em> you try it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, the upshot was, that they dared him to try it. A dozen, or
so, set on at him like so many wolves. What with that, and what
with their stinging ridicule, poor Van Rheyn was goaded out of his
obedience to home orders, and did try it. After a few tumbles, he
went over very tolerably, and did not dislike it at all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can only learn to do as the rest of you do, perhaps they will
let me alone,&rdquo; he said to me that same night, a sort of eagerness in his
bright grey eyes.</p>

<p>And gradually he did learn to go in for most of the games: running,
leaping, and climbing. One thing he absolutely refused&mdash;wrestling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should gentlemen, who were to be gentlemen all their lives,
fight each other?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;They would not have to fight as men;
it was not kind; it was not pleasant; it was hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys were hard on him for saying it, mocking him fearfully;
but they could not shake him there. He was of right blue blood;
never caving-in before them, as Bill Whitney expressed it one day; he
was only quiet and <em>endured</em>.</p>

<p>Whether the native Rouen air is favourable to freckles, I don&rsquo;t know;
but those on Van Rheyn&rsquo;s face gradually disappeared over here. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
complexion lost its redness also, becoming fresh and fair, with a
brightish colour on the cheeks. The hair, growing longer, turned out
to be of a smooth brown: altogether he was good-looking.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>&ldquo;I say, Johnny, do you know that Van Rheyn&rsquo;s ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words came from William Whitney. He whispered them in
my ear as we stood up for prayers before breakfast. The school had
opened about a month then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Bill. &ldquo;He is staying in bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cribbing some minutes from breakfast, I went up to his room. Van
Rheyn looked pale as he lay, and said he had been sick. Hall declared
it was nothing but a bilious attack, and Van Rheyn thought she might
be right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning that you have a sick headache, I suppose?&rdquo; I said to
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the migraine. I have had it before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, look here, Charley,&rdquo; I went on, after thinking a minute;
&ldquo;if I were you, I wouldn&rsquo;t say as much to any of them. Let them
suppose you are regularly ill. You&rsquo;ll never hear the last of it if they
know you lie in bed for only a headache.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I cannot get up,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;my head is in much pain.
And I have fever. Feel my hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hand he put out was burning hot. But that went with sick
headaches sometimes.</p>

<p>It turned out to be nothing worse, for he was well on the morrow;
and I need not have mentioned it at all, but for a little matter that arose
out of the day&rsquo;s illness. Going up again to see him after school in the
afternoon, I found Hall standing over the bed with a cup of tea, and a
most severe, not to say horror-struck expression of countenance, as she
gazed down on him, staring at something with all her eyes. Van
Rheyn was asleep, and looked better; his face flushed and moist, his
brown hair, still uncommonly short compared with ours, pushed back.
He lay with his hands outside the bed, as if the clothes were heavy&mdash;the
weather was fiery hot. One of the hands was clasping something
that hung round his neck by a narrow blue ribbon; it seemed to have
been pulled by him out of the opening in his night-shirt. Hall&rsquo;s quick
eyes had detected what it was&mdash;a very small flat cross (hardly two
inches long), on which was carved a figure of the Saviour, all in gold.</p>

<p>Now Hall had doubtless many virtues. One of them was docking us
boys of our due allowance of sugar. But she had also many prejudices.
And, of all her prejudices, none was stronger than her abhorrence of
idols, as exemplified in carved images and Chinese gods.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see that, Master Ludlow?&rdquo; she whispered to me, pointing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
her finger straight at the little cross of gold. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no better than a
relict of paganism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stooping down, she gently drew the cross out of Van Rheyn&rsquo;s hot
clasped hand, and let it lie on the sheet. A beautiful little cross; the
face of our Saviour&mdash;an exquisite face in its expression of suffering and
patient humility&mdash;one that you might have gazed upon and been the
better for. How they could have so perfectly carved a thing so small
I knew not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be one of them worshipping Romanics,&rdquo; said Hall, with
horror, snatching her fingers from the cross as if she thought it would
give her the ague. &ldquo;Or else a pagan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the two were no doubt alike in Hall&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he goes every week and says his commandments in class here,
standing up before all the school! I wonder what the doctor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hall cut short her complaints. Van Rheyn had suddenly opened his
eyes, and was looking up at us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I find myself better,&rdquo; he said, with a smile. &ldquo;The pain has nearly
departed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We wasn&rsquo;t thinking of pains and headaches, Master Van Rheyn,
but of <em>this</em>,&rdquo; said Hall, resentfully, taking the spoon out of the saucer,
and holding it within an inch of the gold cross. Van Rheyn raised his
head from the pillow to look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is my little cross!&rdquo; he said, holding it out to our view as far
as the ribbon allowed, and speaking with perfect ease and unconcern.
&ldquo;Is it not beautiful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; I said, stooping over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be you of the Romanic sex?&rdquo; demanded Hall of Van Rheyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I&mdash;&mdash; What is it Mrs. Hall would ask?&rdquo; he broke off to
question me, in the midst of my burst of laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She asks if you are a Roman Catholic, Van Rheyn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But no. Why you think that?&rdquo; he added to her. &ldquo;My father is
a Roman Catholic: I am a Protestant, like my mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why on earth, sir, do you wear such a idol as that?&rdquo; returned
Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This? Oh, it is nothing! it is not an idol. It does me good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; fiercely repeated Hall. &ldquo;Does you good to wear a brazen
image next the skin!&mdash;right under the flannel waistcoat. I wonder
what the school will come to next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I not wear it?&rdquo; said Van Rheyn. &ldquo;What harm does
it do me, this? It was my poor Aunt Annette&rsquo;s. The last time we
went to the Aunt Claribelle&rsquo;s to see her, when the hope of her was
gone, she put the cross into my hand, and bade me keep it for her
sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Master Van Rheyn, it&rsquo;s just a brazen image,&rdquo; persisted
Hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a keepsake,&rdquo; dissented Van Rheyn. &ldquo;I showed it to
Monsieur Mons one day when he was calling on mamma, and told him
it was a gift to me of the poor Tante Annette. Monsieur Mons
thought it very pretty, and said it would remind me of the great
Sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But to wear it next your skin,&rdquo; went on Hall, not giving in.
Giving in on the matter of graven images was not in her nature. Or
on any matter as far as that went, that concerned us boys. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
heard of poor misdeluded people putting horse-hair next &rsquo;em. And
fine torment it must be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have worn it since mamma died,&rdquo; quietly answered Van Rheyn,
who did not seem to understand Hall&rsquo;s zeal. &ldquo;She kept it for me
always in her little shell-box that had the silver crest on it; but when
she died, I said I would put the cross round my neck, for fear of losing
it: and Aunt Claribelle, who took the shell-box then, bought me the
blue ribbon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That blue ribbon&rsquo;s new&mdash;or almost new&mdash;if ever I saw new
ribbon,&rdquo; cried Hall, who was in a mood to dispute every word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes. It was new when I left Rouen. I have another piece in
my trunk to put on when this shall wear out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a horrid heathenish thing to do, Master Van Rheyn;
and, though it may be gold, I don&rsquo;t believe Miss Emma Aberleigh
would ever have gave countenance to it. Leastways before she lived
among them foreign French folks,&rdquo; added Hall, virtually dropping the
contest, as Van Rheyn slipped the cross out of view within his night-shirt.
&ldquo;What she might have come to, after she went off there, Heaven
alone knows. Be you going to drink this tea, sir, or be you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Van Rheyn drank the tea and thanked her for bringing it, his
gratitude shining also out of his nice grey eyes. Hall took back the
cup and tucked him up again, telling him to get a bit more sleep and
he would be all right in the morning. With all her prejudices and
sourness, she was as good as gold when any of us were ill.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>&ldquo;Not bathe! Not bathe! I say, you fellows, here&rsquo;s a lark.
Bristles thinks he&rsquo;d better not try the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a terribly hot evening, close upon sunset. Finding ourselves,
some half-dozen of us, near the river, Van Rheyn being one, the
water looked too pleasant not to be plunged into. The rule at Dr.
Frost&rsquo;s was, that no boy should be compelled to bathe against his
inclination: Van Rheyn was the only one who had availed himself of
it. It was Parker who spoke: we were all undressing quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your objection, Miss Charlotte? Girls bathe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They would never let me go into cold water at home,&rdquo; was the
patient answer. &ldquo;We take warm baths there.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Afraid of cold water? well I never! What an everlasting pussy-cat
you are, Miss Charlotte! We&rsquo;ve heard that pussies don&rsquo;t like to
wet their feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our doctor at Rouen used to say I must not plunge into cold
water,&rdquo; said poor Van Rheyn, speaking patiently as usual, though he
must have been nearly driven wild. &ldquo;The shock would not be good
for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, who&rsquo;ll write off to Evesham for a pair of waterproofs to put
over his shoes? Just give us the measure of your foot, Miss
Charlotte?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s shut him up in a feather-bed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the water&rsquo;s not cold, you donkey!&rdquo; cried Bill Whitney, who
had just leaped in. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as warm as new milk. What on earth will
you be fit for, Bristles? You&rsquo;ll never make a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make a man! What are you thinking of, Whitney? Miss
Charlotte has no ambition that way. Girls prefer to grow up into
young ladies, not into men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it truly warm?&rdquo; asked Van Rheyn, gazing at the river irresolutely,
and thinking that if he went in the mockery might cease.</p>

<p>I looked up at him from the water. &ldquo;It is indeed, Van Rheyn.
Quite warm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He knew he might trust me, and began slowly to undress. We had
continued to be the best of comrades, and I never went in for teasing him
as the rest did; rather shielded him when I could, and took his part.</p>

<p>By the time he was ready to go in&mdash;for he did nothing nimbly, and
undressing made no exception&mdash;some of us were ready to come out.
One of Dr. Frost&rsquo;s rules in regard to bathing was stringent&mdash;that no
boy should remain in the water more than three minutes at the very
extent. He held that a great deal of harm was done by prolonged
bathing. Van Rheyn plunged in&mdash;and liked it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is warm and pleasant,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;This cannot hurt me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurt you, you great baby!&rdquo; shouted Parker.</p>

<p>Van Rheyn had put his clothes in the tidiest manner upon the grass;
not like ours, which were flung down any way. His things were laid
smoothly one upon another, in the order he took them off, though I
dare say I should not have noticed this but for a shout from Jessup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halloa! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those of us who were out, and in the several stages of drying or
dressing, turned round at the words. Jessup, buttoning his braces,
was standing by Van Rheyn&rsquo;s heap, looking down at it. On the top of
the flannel vest, exposed to full view, lay the gold cross with the blue
ribbon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth <em>is</em> it?&rdquo; cried Jessup, picking it up; and at the
moment Van Rheyn, finding all the rest out of the water, came out
himself. &ldquo;Is it a charm?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is mine&mdash;it is my gold cross,&rdquo; spoke Van Rheyn, catching up
one of the wet towels. The bath this evening had been impromptu,
and we had only two towels between us, which Parker and Whitney
had brought. In point of fact, it had been against rules also, for we
were not expected to go into the river without the presence of a master.
But just at this bend it was perfectly safe. Jessup passed the blue
ribbon round his neck, letting the cross hang behind. This done, he
turned himself about for general inspection, and the boys crowded
round to look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you say it is, Bristles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My gold cross.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to tell us to our faces that you wear it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wear it always,&rdquo; freely answered Van Rheyn.</p>

<p>Jessup took it off his neck, and the boys passed it about from one to
another. They did not ridicule the cross&mdash;I think the emblem on it
prevented that&mdash;but they ridiculed Van Rheyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A friend of mine went over to the tar-and-feather islands,&rdquo; said
Millichip, executing an aggravating war-dance round about Charley.
&ldquo;He found the natives sporting no end of charms and amulets&mdash;nearly
all the attire they did sport&mdash;rings in the nose and chains in the ears.
What relation are those natives to you, Miss Charlotte?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t injure it, please,&rdquo; pleaded Van Rheyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve an ancient nurse at home who carries the tip of a calf&rsquo;s
tongue in her pocket for luck,&rdquo; shrieked Thorne. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve heard&mdash;I
<em>have</em> heard, Bristles&mdash;that any fellow who arms himself with a
pen&rsquo;orth of blue-stone from the druggist&rsquo;s, couldn&rsquo;t have the yellow
jaundice if he tried. What might you wear this for, pray?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Aunt Annette gave it me as a present when she was dying,&rdquo;
answered poor helpless Charley, who had never the smallest notion
of taking chaff otherwise than seriously, or of giving chaff back again.</p>

<p>He had dressed himself to his trousers and shirt, and stood with his
hand stretched out, waiting for his cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the <cite>Worcester Journal</cite>, one day last June, I read an advertisement
as big as a house, offering a child&rsquo;s caul for sale,&rdquo; cried Snepp.
&ldquo;Any gentleman or lady buying that caul and taking it to sea, could
never be drowned. Bristles thinks as long as he wears this, he won&rsquo;t
come to be hanged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your grandmother, Miss Charlotte?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would please to let me alone,&rdquo; said he patiently. &ldquo;My
father would not have placed me here had he known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you write and tell him, Bristles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not like to grieve him,&rdquo; simply answered Charley. &ldquo;I
can bear. And he does so much want me to learn good English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This cross is gold, I suppose?&rdquo; said Bill Whitney, who now had it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is gold,&rdquo; answered Van Rheyn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t advise you to fall amongst thieves, then. They might
ease you of it. The carving must be worth something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It cost a great deal to buy, I have heard my aunt say. Will you
be so good as to give it me, that I may finish to dress myself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whitney handed him the cross. Time was up, in fact; and we had
to make a race for the house. Van Rheyn was catching it hot and
sharp, all the way.</p>

<p>One might have thought that his very meekness, the unresisting
spirit in which he took things, would have disarmed the mockery.
But it did not. Once go in wholesale for putting upon some particular
fellow in a school, and the tyranny gains with use. I don&rsquo;t think any
of them meant to be really unkind to Van Rheyn; but the play had
begun, and they enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I once saw him drowned in tears. It was at the dusk of evening.
Charley had come in for it awfully at tea-time, I forget what about,
and afterwards disappeared. An hour later, going into Whitney&rsquo;s
room for something Bill asked me to fetch, I came upon Charles Van
Rheyn&mdash;who also slept there. He was sitting at the foot of his low
bed, his cheek leaning on one of his hands, and the tears running down
swiftly. One might have thought his heart was broken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the grievance, Charley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not say to them that you saw me,&rdquo; returned he, dashing away
his tears. &ldquo;I did not expect any of you would come up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, old fellow: I know it&rsquo;s rather hard lines for you just
now. But they don&rsquo;t mean anything: it is done in sport, not malice.
They don&rsquo;t <em>think</em>, you see, Van Rheyn. You will be sure to live it
down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;I hope I shall. But it is so different here from
what it used to be. I had such a happy home; I never had one
sorrow when my mother was alive. Nobody cares for me now;
nobody is kind to me: it is a great change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take heart, Charley,&rdquo; I said, holding out my hand. &ldquo;I know you
will live it down in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of all the fellows I ever met, I think he was the most grateful for a
word of kindness. As he thanked me with a glad look of hope in
his eyes, I saw that he had been holding the cross clasped in his palm;
for it dropped as he put his hand into mine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It helps me to bear,&rdquo; he said, in a whisper. &ldquo;My mother, who
loved me so, is in heaven; my father has married Mademoiselle
Thérèsine de Tocqueville. I have no one now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father has not married that Thérèsine de Tocqueville?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. I had the letter close after dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So perhaps he was crying for the home unhappiness as much as for
his school grievances. It all reads strange, no doubt, and just the
opposite of what might be expected of one of us English boys. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
French bringing-tip is different from ours: perhaps it lay in that. On
the other hand, a French boy, generally speaking, possesses a very
shallow sense of religion. But Van Rheyn had been reared by his
English mother; and his disposition seemed to be naturally serious and
uncommonly pliable and gentle. At any rate, whether it reads
improbable or probable, it is the truth.</p>

<p>I got what I wanted for Billy Whitney, and went down, thinking
what a hard life it was for him&mdash;what a shame that we made it so.
Indulged, as Van Rheyn must have always been, tenderly treated as a
girl, sheltered from the world&rsquo;s roughness, all that coddling must have
become to him as second nature; and the remembrance lay with him
still. Over here he was suddenly cut off from it, thrown into another
and a rougher atmosphere, isolated from country, home, home-ties and
associations; and compelled to stand the daily brunt of this petty
tyranny.</p>

<p>Getting Tod apart that night, I put the matter to him: what a
shame it was, and how sorry I felt for Charley Van Rheyn; and I
asked him whether he thought he could not (he having a great deal of
weight in the school) make things pleasanter for him. Tod responded
that I should never be anything but a muff, and that the roasting Van
Rheyn got treated to was superlatively good for him, if ever he was to
be made into a man.</p>

<p>However, before another week ran out, Dr. Frost interfered. How
he obtained an inkling of the reigning politics we never knew. One
Saturday afternoon, when old Fontaine had taken Van Rheyn out with
him, the doctor walked into the midst of us, to the general consternation.</p>

<p>Standing in the centre of the schoolroom, with a solemn face, all of
us backing as much as the wall allowed, and the masters who chanced
to be present rising to their feet, the doctor spoke of Van Rheyn. He
had reason to suspect, he said, that we were doing our best to worry
Van Rheyn&rsquo;s life out of him: and he put the question deliberately to
us (and made us answer it), how we, if consigned alone to a foreign
home, all its inmates strangers, would liked to be served so. He did
not wish, he went on, to think he had pitiful, ill-disposed boys, lacking
hearts and common kindness, in his house: he felt sure that what had
passed arose from a heedless love of mischief; and it would greatly
oblige him to find from henceforth that our conduct towards Van Rheyn
was changed: he thought, and hoped, that he had only to express a
wish upon the point, to ensure obedience.</p>

<p>With that&mdash;and a hearty nod and smile around, as if he put it as a
personal favour to himself, and wanted us to see that he did, and was
not angry, he went out again. A counsel was held to determine
whether we had a sneak amongst us&mdash;else how could Frost have
known?&mdash;that Charley himself had not spoken, his worst enemy felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
sure of. But not one could be pitched upon: every individual fellow,
senior and junior, protested earnestly that he had not let out a syllable.
And, to tell the truth, I don&rsquo;t think we had.</p>

<p>However, the doctor was obeyed. From that day all real annoyance
to Charles Van Rheyn ceased. I don&rsquo;t say but what there would
be a laugh at him now and then, and a word of raillery, or that he lost
his names of Bristles and Miss Charlotte; but virtually the sting was
gone. Charley was as grateful as could be, and seemed to become
quite happy; and upon the arrival of a hamper by grande vitesse from
Rouen, containing a huge rich wedding-cake and some packets of costly
sweetmeats, he divided the whole amongst us, keeping the merest taste
for himself. The school made its comments in return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a bad lot after all, that Van Rheyn. He will make a man
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a bit of use your going in for this, Van Rheyn, unless you
can run like a lamplighter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can run, you know,&rdquo; responded Van Rheyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But can you keep the pace up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We may be out for three or four hours, pelting like mad all the
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel no fear of keeping up,&rdquo; said Van Rheyn. &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was on a Saturday afternoon; and we were turning out for hare
and hounds. The quarter was hard upon its close, for September was
passing. Van Rheyn had never seen hare and hounds: it had been let
alone during the hotter weather: and it was Tod who now warned him
that he might not be able to keep up the running. It requires fleet legs
and easy breath, as every one knows; and Van Rheyn had never much
exercised either.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is just the game?&rdquo; he asked in his quaintly-turned phrase.
And I answered him&mdash;for Tod had gone away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see those strips of paper that they have torn out of old copybooks,
and are twisting? That is for the scent. The hare fills his
pockets with it, and drops a piece of it every now and then as he runs.
We, the hounds, follow his course by means of the scent, and catch him
if we can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; questioned Van Rheyn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the game is over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what if you not catch him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hare wins; that&rsquo;s all. What he likes to do is to double upon
us cunningly and lead us home again after him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But in all that there is only running.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We vault over the obstructions&mdash;gates, and stiles, and hedges. Or,
if the hedges are too high, scramble through them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But some hedges are very thick and close: nobody could get
through them,&rdquo; debated Van Rheyn, taking the words, as usual, too
literally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we are dished. And have to find some other way onwards,
or turn back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do what you say quite easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Charley,&rdquo; I repeated: as Tod had done. And neither of
us, nor any one else, had the smallest thought that it was not all right.</p>

<p>Millichip was chosen hare. Snepp turned cranky over something or
other at the last moment, and backed out of it. He made the best
hare in the school: but Millichip was nearly as fleet a runner.</p>

<p>What with making the scent, and having it out with Snepp, time
was hindered; and it must have been getting on for four o&rsquo;clock when
we started. Which docked the run considerably, for we had to be in
at six to tea. On that account, perhaps, Millichip thought he must get
over the ground the quicker; for I don&rsquo;t think we had ever made so
swift a course. Letting the hare get well on ahead, the signal was
given, and we started after him in full cry, rending the air with shouts,
and rushing along like the wind.</p>

<p>A right-down good hare Millichip turned out to be; doubling and
twisting and finessing, and exasperating the hounds considerably.
About five o&rsquo;clock he had made tracks for home, as we found by the
scent: but we could neither see him nor catch him. Later, I chanced
to come to grief in a treacherous ditch, lost my straw hat, and tore the
sleeve of my jacket. This threw me behind the rest; and when I
pelted up to the next stile, there stood Van Rheyn. He had halted to
rest his arms on it; his breath was coming in alarming gasps, his face
whiter than a sheet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halloa, Van Rheyn! What&rsquo;s up? The pace is too much for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was my breath,&rdquo; said he, when he could answer. &ldquo;I go on
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I put my hand on him. &ldquo;Look here: the run&rsquo;s nearly over: we
shall soon be at home. Don&rsquo;t go on so fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I want to be in at what they call the death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no death to-day: the hare&rsquo;s safe to win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to keep up,&rdquo; he answered, getting over the stile. &ldquo;I said
I could keep up, and do what the rest did.&rdquo; And off he was again,
full rush.</p>

<p>Before us, on that side of the stile, was a tolerably wide field. The
pack had wound half over it during this short halt, making straight for
the entrance to the coppice at the other end. We were doing our best
to catch them up, when I distinctly saw a heavy stone flung into their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
midst. Looking at the direction it came from, there crept a dirty
ragamuffin over the ground on his hands and knees. He did not see
us two behind; and he flung another heavy stone. Had it struck anyone&rsquo;s
head it would have done serious damage.</p>

<p>Letting the chase go, I stole across and pounced upon him before he
could get away. He twisted himself out of my hands like an eel, and
stood grinning defiance and whistling to his dog. We knew the young
scamp well: and could never decide whether he was a whole scamp,
or half a natural. At any rate, he was vilely bad, was the pest of the
neighbourhood, and had enjoyed some short sojourns in prison for
trespass. Raddy was the name he went by; we knew him by no other;
and how he got a living nobody could tell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you throw those stones for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t tell ye. Didn&rsquo;t throw &rsquo;em at you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better mind what you are about, Mr. Raddy, unless you
want to get into trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yah&mdash;you!&rdquo; grinned Raddy.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be made of him; there never was anything.
I should have been no match for Raddy in an encounter; and he would
have killed me without the slightest compunction. Turning to go on
my way, I was in time to see Van Rheyn tumble over the stile and
disappear within the coppice. The rest must have nearly shot out of
the other end by that time. It was a coppice that belonged to Sir
John Whitney. Once through it, we were on our own grounds, and
within a field of home.</p>

<p>I went on leisurely enough: no good to try to catch them up now.
Van Rheyn would not do it, and he had more than half a field&rsquo;s start
of me. It must have been close upon six, for the sun was setting in a
ball of fire; the amber sky around it was nearly as dazzling as the sun,
and lighted up the field.</p>

<p>So that, plunging into the coppice, it was like going into a dungeon.
For a minute or two, with the reflection of that red light lingering in
my eyes, I could hardly see the narrow path; the trees were dark,
thick, and met overhead. I ran along whistling: wondering whether
that young Raddy was after me with his ugly dog; wondering why Sir
John did not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The whistling and the thoughts came to a summary end together.
At the other end of the coppice, but a yard or two on this side the
stile that divided it from the open field, there was Charles Van Rheyn
on the ground, his back against the trunk of a tree, his arms stretched
up, clasping it. But for that clasp, and the laboured breathing, I
might have thought he was dead. For his face was ghastly, blue
round the mouth, and wore the strangest expression I ever saw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charley, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he could not answer. He was panting frightfully, as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
every gasp would be his last. What on earth was I to do? Down I
knelt, saying never another word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;gives&mdash;me&mdash;much&mdash;hurt,&rdquo; said he, at length, with a long pause
between every word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to his chest&mdash;towards the left side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hurt yourself? Did you fall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I not hurt myself. I fell because I not able to run more. It
is the breath. I wish papa was near me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instinct told me that he must have assistance, and yet I did not like
to leave him. But what if delay in getting it should be dangerous? I
rose up to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you are not going to quit me!&rdquo; he cried out, putting his
feeble grasp on my arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Charley, I want to get somebody to you,&rdquo; I said in an agony,
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do anything for you myself: anything in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you stay. I should not like to be alone if I die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shock the word gave me I can recall yet. Die! If there was
any fear of <em>that</em>, it was all the more necessary I should make a rush for
Dr. Frost and Featherston. Never had I been so near my wits&rsquo; end
before, in the uncertainty as to what course I ought to take.</p>

<p>All in a moment, there arose a shrill whistle on the other side the
stile. It was like a godsend. I knew it quite well for that vicious
young reptile&rsquo;s, but it was welcome to me as sunshine in harvest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Raddy, Van Rheyn. I will send him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vaulting over the stile, I saw the young man standing with his back
to me near the hedge, his wretched outer garment&mdash;a sack without
shape&mdash;hitched up, his hands in the pockets of his dilapidated trousers,
that hung in fringes below the knee. He was whistling to his dog in
the coppice. They must have struck through the tangles and briars
higher up, which was a difficult feat, and strictly forbidden by law. It
was well Sir John&rsquo;s agent did not see Mr. Raddy&mdash;whose eyes, scratched
and bleeding, gave ample proof of the trespass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yah!&rdquo; he shrieked out, turning at the sound of me, and grinning
fresh defiance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Raddy,&rdquo; I said, speaking in persuasive tones to propitiate him in
my great need, &ldquo;I want you to do something for me. Go to Dr. Frost
as quickly as you are able, and say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of all the derisive horrible laughs, his interruption was the worst and
loudest. It drowned the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the school has fallen and hurt himself,&rdquo; I said, putting it in
that way. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s lying here, and I cannot leave him. Hush, Raddy!
I want to tell you,&rdquo;&mdash;advancing a step or two nearer to him and lowering
my voice to a whisper,&mdash;&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s dying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None o&rsquo; yer gammon here; none o&rsquo; yer lies&rdquo;&mdash;and in proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
as I advanced, he retreated. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a ambush in that there
coppy&mdash;all the lot on you a-waiting to be down on me! Just you
try it on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am telling you the truth, Raddy. There&rsquo;s not a soul in there but
the one I speak of. I say I fear he is dying. He is lying helpless. I
will pay you to go&rdquo;&mdash;feeling in my pockets to see how much I had
there.</p>

<p>Raddy displayed his teeth: it was a trick of his when feeling particularly
defiant. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll yer pay me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sixpence&rdquo;&mdash;showing it to him. &ldquo;I will give it you when you
have taken the message.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just for a moment I hesitated in my extremity, but I knew it would
be only the sixpence thrown away. Paid beforehand, Raddy would no
more do the errand than he&rsquo;d fly. I told him as much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then be dashed if I go!&rdquo; And he passed off into a round of
swearing.</p>

<p>Good Heavens! If I should not be able to persuade him! If
Charles Van Rheyn should die for want of help!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever have anybody to care for, Raddy? Did you ever
have a mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her&rsquo;s sent over the seas, her is; and I be glad on&rsquo;t. Her beated
me, her did: I wasn&rsquo;t a-going to stand that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you ever had anybody you cared for the least bit in the world,
Raddy; if you ever did anybody a good turn in all your life, you will
help this poor fellow now. Come and look at him. See whether I
dare leave him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None o&rsquo; yer swindles! Ye wants to get me in there, ye does. I
warn&rsquo;t borned yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, it seemed hopeless. &ldquo;Will you go for the sixpence, if I give
it to you beforehand, Raddy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it over, and see. Where the thunder have ye been?&rdquo; dealing
his dog a savage kick, as it came up barking. &ldquo;Be I to whistle all
day?&rdquo; Another kick.</p>

<p>I had found two sixpences in my pocket; all its store. Bringing
forth one, I held it out to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now listen, Raddy. I give you this sixpence now. You are to
run with all your might to the house&mdash;and you can run, you know, like
the wind. Say that I sent you&mdash;you know my name, Johnny Ludlow&mdash;sent
you to tell them that the French boy is in the coppice dying;&rdquo;
for I thought it best to put it strong. &ldquo;Dr. Frost, or some of them,
must come to him at once, and they must send off for Mr. Featherston.
You can remember that. The French boy, mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could remember it if I tried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll give you the sixpence. And look here&mdash;here&rsquo;s another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
sixpence. It is all the money I have. That shall be yours also, when
you have done the errand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I slipped one of the sixpences back into my pocket, holding out the
other. But I have often wondered since that he did not stun me with
a blow, and take the two. Perhaps he could not entirely divest himself
of that idea of the &ldquo;ambush.&rdquo; I did not like the leering look on his
false face as he sidled cautiously up towards the sixpence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a look at him; you can see him from the stile,&rdquo; I said, closing
my hand over the sixpence while I spoke; &ldquo;convince yourself that he
is there, and that no trickery is meant. And, Raddy,&rdquo; I added, slowly
opening the hand again, &ldquo;perhaps you may want help one of these
days yourself in some desperate need. Do this good turn for him, and
the like will be done for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I tossed him the sixpence. He stole cautiously to the stile, making
a wide circuit round me to do it, glanced at Van Rheyn, and then made
straight off in the right direction as fast as his legs would carry him,
the dog barking at his heels.</p>

<p>Van Rheyn was better when I got back to him; his breathing easier,
the mouth less blue; and his arms were no longer clutching the tree-trunk.
Nevertheless, there was that in his face that gave me an awful
fear and made my breath for a moment nearly as short as his. I sat
down beside him, letting him lean against me, as well as the tree, for
better support.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid, Charley? I hope they&rsquo;ll not be long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid with this,&rdquo; he answered with a happy smile&mdash;and,
opening his hand, I saw the little cross clasped in it.</p>

<p>Well, that nearly did for me. It was as though he meant to imply
he knew he was dying, and was not afraid to die. And he did mean it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not comprehend?&rdquo; he added, mistaking the look of my
face&mdash;which no doubt was desperate. &ldquo;I have kept the Saviour with
me here, and He will keep me with Him there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;but, Charley! You <em>can&rsquo;t</em> think you are going to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I feel so,&rdquo; he answered quite calmly. &ldquo;My mother said, that
last Sunday, might not be long after her. She drew me close to
her, and held my hand, and her tears were falling with mine. It was
then she said it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Charley! how can I help you?&rdquo; I cried out in my pain and
dread. &ldquo;If I could only do something for you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would like to give you this,&rdquo; he said, half opening his hand again,
as it rested on his breast, just to show me the cross. &ldquo;My mother has
seen how good you have always been for me: she said she should look
down, if permitted, to watch for me till I came. Would you please
keep it to my memory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hardest task I&rsquo;d ever had in my life was to sit there. To sit
there quietly&mdash;helpless. Dying! And I could do nothing to stay him!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Oh, why did they not come? If I could only have run somewhere, or
done something!</p>

<p>In a case like this the minutes seem as long as hours. Dr. Frost
was up sooner than could have been hoped for by the watch, and
Featherston with him. Raddy did his errand well. Chancing to see
the surgeon pass down the road as he was delivering the message at
the house, he ran and arrested him. He put his ill-looking face over
the stile, as they came up, and I flung him the other sixpence, and
thanked him too. The French master came running; others came: I
hardly saw who they were, for my eyes were troubled.</p>

<p>The first thing that Featherston did was to open Van Rheyn&rsquo;s
things at the throat, spread a coat on the ground and put his head flat
down upon it. But oh, there could be no mistake. He was dying:
nearly gone. Dr. Frost knelt down, the better to get at him, and said
something that we did not catch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; answered Van Rheyn, panting again and speaking
with pain, but smiling faintly his grateful smile. &ldquo;Do not be sorrowful.
I shall see my mother. Sir&mdash;if you please&mdash;I wish to give my cross to
Johnny Ludlow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Frost only nodded in answer. His heart must have been full.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny Ludlow has been always good for me,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;He
will guard it to my memory: a keepsake. My mother would give it
to him&mdash;she has seen that Johnny has stood by me ever since that first
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Monsieur Fontaine spoke to him in French, and Van Rheyn
answered in the same language. While giving a fond message for his
father, his voice grew feeble, his face more blue, and the lids slowly
closed over his eyes. Dr. Frost said something about removing him
to the house, but Featherston shook his head. &ldquo;Presently, presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adieu, sir,&rdquo; said Van Rheyn faintly to Dr. Frost, and partly
opening his eyes again, &ldquo;Adieu, Monsieur Fontaine. Adieu, all.
Johnny, say my very best adieux to the boys; tell them it has been
very pleasant lately; say they have been very good comrades; and
say that I shall see them all again when they come to heaven. Will
you hold my hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking his left hand in mine&mdash;the other had the gold cross in it&mdash;I
sat on beside him. The dusk was increasing, so that we could no
longer very well see his features in the dark coppice. My tears were
dropping fast and thick, just as his tears had dropped that evening
when I found him sitting at the foot of his bed.</p>

<p>Well, it was over directly. He gave one long deep sigh, and then
another after an interval, and all was over. It seemed like a dream
then in the acting; it seems, looking back, like a dream now.</p>

<p><em>He had died from the running at Hare and Hounds.</em> The violent
exercise had been too much for the heart. We heard later that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
French family doctor had suspected the heart was not quite sound;
and that was the reason of Monsieur Rheyn&rsquo;s written restrictions on
the score of violent exercise. But, as Dr. Frost angrily observed, why
did the father not distinctly warn him against that special danger:
how was it to be suspected in a lad of hearty and healthy appearance?
Monsieur Van Rheyn came over, and took what remained of Charles
back to Rouen, to be laid beside his late wife. It was a great blow to
him to lose his only son. And all the property went away from the
Van Rheyn family to Mrs. Scott in India.</p>

<p>The school went into a state that night, when we got in from the
coppice, and I gave them Van Rheyn&rsquo;s message. They knew something
was up with him, but never suspected it could be death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, though,&rdquo; cried Harry Parker, in a great access of remorse,
speaking up amidst the general consternation, &ldquo;we would never have
worried him had we foreseen this. Poor Van Rheyn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I have his gold cross by me this day. Sometimes, when
looking at it, a fancy comes over me that he, looking down from
heaven, sees it too.</p>

<h2><span class="f9">VIII.</span><br />

MRS. TODHETLEY&rsquo;S EARRINGS.</h2>


<p>Again we had been spending the Christmas at Crabb Cot. It was
January weather, cold and bright, the sun above and the white snow
on the ground. Mrs. Todhetley had been over to Timberdale Court,
to the christening of Robert and Jane Ashton&rsquo;s baby: a year had gone
by since their marriage. The mater went to represent Mrs. Coney,
who was godmother. Jane was not strong enough to sit out a christening
dinner, and that was to be given later. After some mid-day feasting,
the party dispersed.</p>

<p>I went out to help Mrs. Todhetley from the carriage when she got
back. The Squire was at Pershore for the day. It was only three
o&rsquo;clock, and the sun quite warm in spite of the snow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so fine, Johnny, that I think I&rsquo;ll walk to the school,&rdquo; she said,
as she stepped down. &ldquo;It may not be like this to-morrow, and I must
see about those shirts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The parish school was making Tod a set of new shirts; and some
bother had arisen about them. Orders had been given for large plaits
in front, when Tod suddenly announced that he would have the plaits
small.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only&mdash;&mdash; Can I go as I am?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Todhetley, suddenly
stopping in indecision, as she remembered her fine clothes: a silver-grey
gown that shone like silver, white shawl of china crape, and
be-feathered bonnet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, of course you can go as you are, good mother. And
look all the nicer for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear the children will stare! But then&mdash;if the shirts get made
wrong! Well, will you go with me, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We reached the school-house, I waiting outside while she went in.
It was during that time of strike that I have told of before, when Eliza
Hoar died of it. The strike was in full swing still; the men looked
discontented, the women miserable, the children pinched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what in the world Joseph will say!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Todhetley,
as we were walking back. &ldquo;Two of the shirts are finished
with the large plaits. I ought to have seen about it earlier; but I did
not think they would begin them quite so soon. We&rsquo;ll just step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
into Mrs. Coney&rsquo;s, Johnny, as we go home. I must tell her about the
christening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For Mrs. Coney was a prisoner from an attack of rheumatism. It
had kept her from the festivity. She was asleep, however, when we
got in: and Mr. Coney thought she had better not be disturbed, even
for the news of the little grandson&rsquo;s christening, as she had lain awake
all the past night in pain; so we left again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Johnny! who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaning against the gate of our house, in the red light of the setting
sun, was an elderly woman, dark as a gipsy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tramp,&rdquo; I whispered, noticing her poor clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want anything, my good woman?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Todhetley.</p>

<p>She was half kneeling in the snow, and lifted her face at the words:
a sickly face, that somehow I liked now I saw it closer. Her tale was
this. She had set out from her home, three miles off, to walk to
Worcester, word having been sent her that her daughter, who was in
service there, had met with an accident. She had not been strong of
late, and a faintness came over her as she was passing the gate. But
for leaning on it she must have fallen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should go by train: you should not walk,&rdquo; said Mrs. Todhetley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had not the money just by me, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It &rsquo;ud
cost two shillings or half-a-crown. My daughter sent word I was to
take the train and she&rsquo;d pay for it: but she did not send the money,
and I&rsquo;d not got it just handy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You live at Islip, you say. What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nutt&rsquo;n, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the woman, in the local dialect. Which
name I interpreted into Nutten; but Mrs. Todhetley thought she said
Nutt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are telling me the truth,&rdquo; said the mater, some hesitation
in her voice, though. &ldquo;If I were assured of it I would advance
you half-a-crown for the journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The good Lord above us knows that I&rsquo;m telling it,&rdquo; returned the
woman earnestly, turning her face full to the glow of the sun. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
more than I could expect you to do, ma&rsquo;am, and me a stranger; but
I&rsquo;d repay it faithfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, the upshot was that she got the half-crown lent her; and I
ran in for a drop of warm ale. Molly shrieked out at me for it,
refusing to believe that the mistress gave any such order, and saying
she was not going to warm ale for parish tramps. So I got the ale and
the tin, and warmed it myself. The woman was very grateful, drank
it, and disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Joseph, I am so very sorry! They have made two of your shirts,
and the plaits are the large ones you say you don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll just unmake them,&rdquo; retorted Tod, in a temper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>We were sitting round the table at tea, Mrs. Todhetley having
ordered some tea to be made while she went upstairs. She came down
without her bonnet, and had changed her best gown for the one she
mostly wore at home: it had two shades in it, and shone like the
copper tea-kettle. The Squire was not expected home yet, and we
were to dine an hour later than usual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Miss Timmens is not worth her salt,&rdquo; fired Tod, helping himself
to some thin bread-and-butter. &ldquo;What business has she to go and
make my shirts wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear the fault lies with me, Joseph, not with Miss Timmens. I
had given her the pattern shirt, which has large plaits, you know,
before you said you would prefer&mdash;&mdash; Oh, we hardly want the lamp
yet, Thomas!&rdquo; broke off the mater, as old Thomas came in with the
lighted lamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we do, then,&rdquo; cried Tod. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see which side&rsquo;s
butter and which bread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I, not thinking Miss Timmens would put them in hand at
once, did not send to her as soon as you spoke, Joseph,&rdquo; went on the
mater, as Thomas settled the lamp on the table. &ldquo;I am very sorry,
my dear; but it is only two. The rest shall be done as you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something, apart from the shirts, had put Tod out. I had seen it as
soon as we got in. For one thing, he had meant to go to Pershore:
and the pater, not knowing it, started without him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them unmake the two,&rdquo; growled Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it would be a great pity, Joseph. They are very nicely done;
the stitching&rsquo;s beautiful. I really don&rsquo;t think it will signify.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> don&rsquo;t, perhaps. You may like odd things. A pig with one
ear, for example.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A what, Joseph?&rdquo; she asked, not catching the last simile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said a pig with one ear. No doubt you do like it. You are
looking like one now, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words made me gaze at Mrs. Todhetley, for the tone bore
some personal meaning, and then I saw what Tod meant: an earring
was absent. The lamp-light shone on the flashing diamonds, the
bright pink topaz of the one earring; but the other ear was bare and
empty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have lost one of your earrings, mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put her hands to her ears, and started up in alarm. These
earrings were very valuable: they had been left to her, when she was
a child, in some old lady&rsquo;s will, and constituted her chief possession in
jewellery worth boasting of. Not once in a twelvemonth did she venture
to put them on; but she had got them out to-day for the christening.</p>

<p>Whether it was that I had gazed at the earrings when I was a little
fellow and sat in her lap, I don&rsquo;t know; but I never saw any that I
liked so well. The pink topaz was in a long drop, the slender rim of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
gold that encircled it being set with diamonds. Mrs. Todhetley said
they were worth fifty guineas: and perhaps they were. The glittering
white of the diamonds round the pink was beautiful to look upon.</p>

<p>The house went into a commotion. Mrs. Todhetley made for her
bedroom, to see whether the earring had dropped on the floor or was
lodging inside her bonnet. She shook out her grey dress, hoping it had
fallen amidst the folds. Hannah searched the stairs, candle in hand;
the two children were made to stand in corners for fear they should
tread on it. But the search came to nothing. It seemed clear enough
that the earring was not in the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you notice, Johnny, whether I had them both in my ears when
we went to the school?&rdquo; the mater asked.</p>

<p>No, I did not. I had seen them sparkling when she got out of the
carriage, but had not noticed them after.</p>

<p>I went out to search the garden-path that she had traversed, and the
road over to the Coneys&rsquo; farm. Tod helped me, forgetting his shirts
and his temper. Old Coney said he remarked the earrings while Mrs.
Todhetley was talking to him, and thought how beautiful they were.
That is, he had remarked <em>one</em> of them; he was sure of that; and he
thought if the other had been missing, its absence would have struck
him. But that was just saying nothing; for he could not be certain
that both were there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may hunt till to-morrow morning, and get ten lanterns to it,&rdquo;
cried Molly, in her tart way, meeting us by the bay-tree, as we went
stooping up the path again: &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll be none the nearer finding it.
That tramp got&rsquo;s the earring, Master Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What tramp?&rdquo; demanded Tod, straightening himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tramp that Master Johnny there must needs give hot ale to,&rdquo; returned
Molly. &ldquo;<em>I</em> know what them tramps are worth. They&rsquo;d pull
rings out of ears with their own fingers, give &rsquo;em the chance: and perhaps
this woman did, without the missis seeing her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod turned to me for an explanation. I gave it, and he burst into a
derisive laugh, meant for me and the mater. &ldquo;To think we could be
taken in by such a tale as that!&rdquo; he cried: &ldquo;we should never see tramp,
or half-crown, or perhaps the earring again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire came home in the midst of the stir. He blustered a
little, partly at the loss, chiefly at the encouragement of tramps, calling
it astounding folly. Ordering Thomas to bring a lantern, he went
stooping his old back down the path, and across to Coney&rsquo;s and back
again; not believing any one had searched properly, and finally kicking
the snow about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity this here snow&rsquo;s on the ground, sir,&rdquo; cried Thomas. &ldquo;A
little thing like an earring might easily slip into it in falling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; growled the Squire. &ldquo;That tramp has got the
earring.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe the tramp has,&rdquo; I stoutly said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she
was a tramp at all: and she seemed honest. I liked her face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There goes Johnny with his &lsquo;faces&rsquo; again!&rdquo; said the Squire, in
laughing mockery: and Tod echoed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing you don&rsquo;t have to buy folks by their faces,
Johnny: you&rsquo;d get finely sold sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she had a true voice,&rdquo; I persisted, not choosing to be put down,
also thinking it right to assert what was my conviction. &ldquo;A voice you
might trust without as much as looking at herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, the earring was not to be found; though the search continued
more or less till bed-time, for every other minute somebody would be
looking again on the carpets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not so much for the value I regret it,&rdquo; spoke Mrs. Todhetley,
the tears rising in her meek eyes: &ldquo;as for the old associations connected
with it. I never had the earrings out but they brought back to
me the remembrance of my girlhood&rsquo;s home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early in the morning I ran down to the school-house. More snow
had fallen in the night. The children were flocking in. Miss Timmens
had not noticed the earrings at all, but several of the girls said
they had. Strange to say, though, most of them could not say for
certain whether they saw <em>both</em> the earrings: they thought they did;
but there it ended. Just like old Coney!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure both of them were there,&rdquo; spoke up a nice, clean little
girl, from a back form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Fanny Fairfax?&rdquo; cried Miss Timmens, in her quick
way. &ldquo;Stand up. How are you sure of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please governess, I saw them both,&rdquo; was the answer; and the
child blushed like a peony as she stood up above the others and said it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m quite sure, please, governess. I was looking which o&rsquo; the
two shined the most. &rsquo;Twas when the lady was stooping over the
shirt, and the sun came in at the window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did they look like?&rdquo; asked Miss Timmens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They looked&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and there the young speaker came to a standstill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Fanny Fairfax!&rdquo; cried Miss Timmens, sharply. &ldquo;What
d&rsquo;you stop for? I ask you what the earrings looked like. You must
be able to tell if you saw them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were red, please, governess, and had shining things round
them like the ice when it glitters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s right, Master Johnny,&rdquo; nodded Miss Timmens to me: &ldquo;and
she&rsquo;s a very correct child in general. I think she must have seen both
of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I ran home with the news. They were at breakfast still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a set of muffs the children must be, not to have taken better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
notice!&rdquo; cried Tod. &ldquo;Why, when I saw only the one earring in, it
struck my eye at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for that reason it is almost sure that both of them were in at
the school-house,&rdquo; I rejoined. &ldquo;The children did not particularly
observe the two, but they would have remarked it directly had only
one been in. Old Coney said the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay: it&rsquo;s that tramp that has got it,&rdquo; said the Squire. &ldquo;While
your mother was talking to her, it must have slipped out of the ear, and
she managed to secure it. Those tramps lay their hands on anything;
nothing comes amiss to them; they are as bad as gipsies. I dare say
this was a gipsy&mdash;dark as she was. I&rsquo;ll be off to Worcester and see
the police: we&rsquo;ll soon have <em>her</em> found. You had better come with me,
Johnny; you&rsquo;ll be able to describe her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We went off without delay, caught a passing train, and were soon at
Worcester and at the police-station. The Squire asked for Sergeant
Cripp: who came to him, and prepared to listen to his tale.</p>

<p>He began it in his impulsive way; saying outright that the earring
had been stolen by a gipsy-tramp. I tried to say that it might have been
only lost, but the pater scoffed at that, and told me to hold my tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Cripp, what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; he demanded, not having
given the sergeant an opportunity to put in a word edgeways. &ldquo;We
must get the earring back; it is of value, and much prized, apart from
that, by Mrs. Todhetley. The woman must be found, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she must be found,&rdquo; agreed the sergeant. &ldquo;Can you give me
a description of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny&mdash;this young gentleman can,&rdquo; said the Squire, rubbing his
brow with his yellow silk handkerchief, for he had put himself into a
heat, in spite of the frosty atmosphere that surrounded us. &ldquo;He was
with Mrs. Todhetley when she talked to the woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thin woman of middle height, stooped a good deal, face pale and
quiet, wrinkles on it, brown eyes,&rdquo; wrote the sergeant, taking down
what I said. &ldquo;Black poke bonnet, clean cap border, old red woollen
shawl with the fringe torn off in places. Can&rsquo;t remember gown:
except that it was dark and shabby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, of course, sir, you&rsquo;ve no clue to her name?&rdquo; cried the
sergeant, looking at me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes: she said it was Nutten&mdash;as I understood it; but Mrs. Todhetley
thought she said Nutt.&rdquo; And I went on to relate the tale the
woman told. Sergeant Cripp&rsquo;s lips extended themselves in a silent
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was well got up, that tale,&rdquo; said he, when I finished. &ldquo;Just the
thing to win over a warm-hearted lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she could not have halted at the gate, expecting to steal the
earring?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not. She was prowling about to see what she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
steal, perhaps watching her opportunity to get into the house. The
earring fell in her way, a more valuable prize than she expected, and
she made off with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be able to hunt her up if she&rsquo;s in Worcester, Cripp,&rdquo; put in
the pater. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>If</em> she&rsquo;s in Worcester,&rdquo; returned Mr. Cripp, with emphasis. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
about as likely to be in Worcester, Squire Todhetley, as I am to be at
this present minute in Brummagem,&rdquo; he familiarly added. &ldquo;After
saying she was coming to Worcester, she&rsquo;d strike off in the most
opposite direction to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where on earth are we to look for her, then?&rdquo; asked the pater, in
commotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave it to us, Squire. We&rsquo;ll try and track her. And&mdash;I hope&mdash;get
back the earring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And about the advertisement for the newspapers, Cripp? We ought
to put one in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sergeant Cripp twirled the pen in his fingers while he reflected. &ldquo;I
think, sir, we will let the advertisement alone for a day or two,&rdquo; he
presently said. &ldquo;Sometimes these advertisements do more harm than
good: they put thieves on their guard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they? Well, I suppose they do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the earring had been simply lost, then I should send an advertisement
to the papers at once. But if it has been stolen by this
tramp, and you appear to consider that point pretty conclusive&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, quite conclusive,&rdquo; interrupted the pater. &ldquo;She has that
earring as sure as this is an umbrella in Johnny Ludlow&rsquo;s hand.
Had it been dropped anywhere on the ground, we must have
found it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we won&rsquo;t advertise it. At least not in to-morrow&rsquo;s papers,&rdquo;
concluded Sergeant Cripp. And telling us to leave the matter entirely
in his hands, he showed us out.</p>

<p>The Squire went up the street with his hands in his pockets, looking
rather glum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that he&rsquo;s right about the advertisement, Johnny,&rdquo; he
said at length. &ldquo;I lay awake last night in bed, making up the wording
of it in my own mind. Perhaps he knows best, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose he does, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he went on again, up one street, and down another, deep in
thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see&mdash;we have nothing to do here to-day, have we, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except to get the pills made up. The mother said we were to be
sure and not forget them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ay. And that&rsquo;s all the way down in Sidbury! Couldn&rsquo;t we
as well get them made up by a druggist nearer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is the Sidbury druggist who holds the prescription.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What a bother! Well, lad, let us put our best leg foremost, for I
want to catch the one-o&rsquo;clock train, if I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barely had we reached Sidbury, when who should come swinging
along the pavement but old Coney, in a rough white great-coat and
top-boots. Not being market-day, we were surprised to see him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had to come in about some oats,&rdquo; he explained. And then the
Squire told him of our visit to the place, and the sergeant&rsquo;s opinion
about the advertisement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cripp&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; said Coney, decisively. &ldquo;Not advertise the earring!&mdash;why,
it is the first step that ought to be taken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, so I thought,&rdquo; said the pater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The thing&rsquo;s not obliged to have been stolen, Squire; it may have
been dropped out of the ear in the road, and picked up by some one.
The offering of a reward might bring it back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll be shot if I don&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; exclaimed the pater. &ldquo;I can see
as far through a millstone as Cripp can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turning into the Hare and Hounds, which was old Coney&rsquo;s inn, they
sat down at a table, called for pen and ink, and began to draw out an
advertisement between them. &ldquo;Lost! An earring of great value,
pink topaz and diamonds,&rdquo; wrote the Squire on a leaf of his pocket-book;
and when he had got as far as that he looked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny, you go over to Eaton&rsquo;s for a sheet or two of writing-paper.
We&rsquo;ll have it in all three of the newspapers. And look here, lad&mdash;you
can run for the pills at the same time. Take care of the street slides.
I nearly came down on one just now, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I got back with the paper and pills, the advertisement was
finished. It concluded with an offer of £5 reward. Applications to be
made to Mr. Sergeant Cripp, or to Squire Todhetley of Crabb Cot.
And, leaving it at the offices of the <cite>Herald</cite>, <cite>Journal</cite>, and <cite>Chronicle</cite>, we
returned home. It would appear on the next day, Saturday; to the
edification, no doubt, of Sergeant Cripp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any news of the earring?&rdquo; was the Squire&rsquo;s first question when we
got in.</p>

<p>No, there was no news of it, Mrs. Todhetley answered. And she had
sent Luke Macintosh over to the little hamlet, Islip; who reported when
he came back that there was no Mrs. Nutt, or Nutten, known there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what I expected,&rdquo; observed the pater. &ldquo;That woman was a
thieving tramp, and she has the earring.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Saturday passed over, and Sunday came. When the Worcester
paper arrived on Saturday morning the advertisement was in it as
large as life, and the pater read it out to us. Friday and Saturday had
been very dull, with storms of snow; on Sunday the sun shone again,
and the air was crisp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>It was about three o&rsquo;clock, and we were sitting at the dessert-table
cracking filberts, for on Sundays we always dined early, after morning
service&mdash;when Thomas came in and said a stranger had called, and
was asking if he could see Mrs. Todhetley. But the mater, putting a
shawl over her head and cap, had just stepped over to sit a bit with
sick Mrs. Coney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it, Thomas?&rdquo; asked the Squire. &ldquo;A stranger! Tell him
to send his name in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name&rsquo;s Eccles, sir,&rdquo; said Thomas, coming back again. &ldquo;He
comes, he says, from Sergeant Cripp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My goodness!&mdash;it must be about the earring,&rdquo; cried the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That it is, sir,&rdquo; said old Thomas. &ldquo;The first word he put to me
was an inquiry whether you had heard news of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I followed the pater into the study. Tod did not leave his filberts.
Standing by the fire was a tall, well-dressed man, with a black
moustache and blue silk necktie. I think the Squire was a little taken
aback at the fashionable appearance of the visitor. He had expected
to see an ordinary policeman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you brought tidings of Mrs. Todhetley&rsquo;s earring?&rdquo; began the
pater, all in a flutter of eagerness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg a thousand pardons for intruding upon you on a Sunday,&rdquo;
returned the stranger, cool and calm as a cucumber, &ldquo;but the loss of
an hour is sometimes most critical in these cases. I have the honour,
I believe, of speaking to Squire Todhetley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire nodded. &ldquo;Am I mistaken in supposing that you come
about the earring?&rdquo; he reiterated. &ldquo;I understood my servant to
mention Sergeant Cripp. But&mdash;you do not, I presume, belong to the
police force?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only as a detective officer,&rdquo; was the answer, given with a taking
smile. &ldquo;A <em>private</em> officer,&rdquo; he added, putting a stress upon the word.
&ldquo;My name is Eccles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a seat, Mr. Eccles,&rdquo; said the Squire, sitting down himself,
while I stood back by the window. &ldquo;I do hope you have brought
tidings of the earring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and no,&rdquo; replied Mr. Eccles, with another fascinating smile,
as he unbuttoned his top-coat. &ldquo;We think we have traced it; but we
cannot yet be sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where is it?&mdash;who has it?&rdquo; cried the Squire, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a very delicate matter, and requires delicate handling,&rdquo;
observed the detective, after a slight pause. &ldquo;For that reason I have
come over to-day myself. Cripp did not choose to entrust it to one of
his men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I am much obliged to him, and to you too,&rdquo; said the
Squire, his face beaming. &ldquo;Where is the earring?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before I answer that question, will you be so kind as to relate to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
me, in a few concise words, the precise circumstances under which the
earring was lost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pater entered on the story, and I helped him. Mr. Eccles
listened attentively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; said he, when it was over. &ldquo;Those are the facts
Cripp gave me; but it was only second-hand, you see, and I preferred
to hear them direct from yourselves. They serve to confirm our
suspicion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where is the earring?&rdquo; repeated the pater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it is where we believe it to be, it is in a gentleman&rsquo;s house at
Worcester. At least he may be called a gentleman. He is a professional
man: a lawyer, in fact. But I may not give names in the
present stage of the affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how did the earring get into his house?&rdquo; pursued the Squire,
all aglow with interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;News reached us last evening,&rdquo; began Mr. Eccles, after searching
in his pockets for something that he apparently could not find: perhaps
a note-case&mdash;&ldquo;reached us in a very singular way, too&mdash;that this gentleman
had been making a small purchase of jewellery in the course of
yesterday; had been making it in private, and did not wish it talked
of. A travelling pedlar&mdash;that was the description we received&mdash;had
come in contact with him and offered him an article for sale, which he,
after some haggling, purchased. By dint of questioning, we discovered
this article to be an earring: one earring, not a pair. Naturally Mr.
Cripp&rsquo;s suspicion was at once aroused: he thought it might be the very
self-same earring that you have lost. We consulted together, and the
result is, I decided to come over and see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d lay all I&rsquo;ve got it is the earring!&rdquo; exclaimed the Squire, in
excitement. &ldquo;The travelling pedlar that sold it must have been that
woman tramp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; returned the detective, quietly. &ldquo;It was a man. Her
husband, perhaps; or some confederate of hers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt of that! And how can we get back the earring?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall get it, sir, never fear; if it be the earring you have lost.
But, as I have just observed, it is a matter that will require extreme
delicacy and caution in the handling. First of all, we must assure
ourselves beyond doubt that the earring <em>is</em> the one in question. To
take any steps upon an uncertainty would not do: this gentleman
might turn round upon us unpleasantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let him,&rdquo; cried the Squire.</p>

<p>The visitor smiled his candid smile again, and shook his head. &ldquo;For
instance, if, after taking means to obtain possession of the earring, we
found it to be coral set with pearls, or opal set with emeralds, instead
of a pink topaz with diamonds, we should not only look foolish ourselves,
but draw down upon us the wrath of the present possessor.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he a respectable man?&rdquo; asked the pater. &ldquo;I know most of the
lawyers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He stands high enough in the estimation of the town, but I have
known him do some very dirty actions in his profession,&rdquo; interrupted
Mr. Eccles, speaking rapidly. &ldquo;With a man like him to deal with, we
must necessarily be wary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first step, Squire Todhetley, is to make ourselves sure that
the earring is the one we are in quest of. With this view, I am here
to request Mrs. Todhetley to allow me to see the fellow-earring. Cripp
has organized a plan by which he believes we can get to see the one
I have been telling you of; but it will be of no use our seeing it unless
we can identify it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not. By all means. Johnny, go over and ask your
mother to come in,&rdquo; added the Squire, eagerly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t
know where she keeps her things, and might look in her places for
ever without finding it. Meanwhile, Mr. Eccles, can I offer you some
refreshment? We have just dined off a beautiful sirloin of beef: it&rsquo;s
partly cold now, but perhaps you won&rsquo;t mind that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Eccles said he would take a little, as the Squire was so good as
to offer it, for he had come off by the first train after morning service,
and so lost his dinner. Taking my hat, I dashed open the dining-room
door in passing. Tod was at the nuts still, Hugh and Lena on
either side of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Tod, do you want to see a real live detective? There&rsquo;s
one in the study.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Who should be seated in the Coneys&rsquo; drawing-room, her bonnet and
shawl on, and her veil nearly hiding her sad face, but Lucy Bird&mdash;Lucy
Ashton that used to be. It always gave me a turn when I saw
her: bringing up all kinds of ugly sorrows and troubles. I shook
hands, and asked after Captain Bird.</p>

<p>She believed he was very well, she said, but she had been spending
the time since yesterday at Timberdale Court with Robert and Jane.
To-day she had been dining with the Coneys&mdash;who were always kind
to her, she added, with a sigh&mdash;and she was now about to go off to the
station to take the train for Worcester.</p>

<p>The mater was in Mrs. Coney&rsquo;s bedroom with old Coney and Cole
the doctor, who was paying his daily visit. One might have thought
they were settling all the cases of rheumatism in the parish by the time
they took over it. While I waited, I told Mrs. Bird about the earring
and the present visit of Detective Eccles. Mrs. Todhetley came down
in the midst of it; and lifted her hands at the prospect of facing a
detective.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me! Is he anything dreadful to look at, Johnny? Very
rough? Has he any handcuffs?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>It made me laugh. &ldquo;He is a regular good-looking fellow&mdash;quite a
gentleman. Tall and slender, and well-dressed: gold studs and a blue
necktie. He has a ring on his finger and wears a black moustache.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bird suddenly lifted her head, and stared at me: perhaps the
description surprised her. The mater seemed inclined to question my
words; but she said nothing, and came away after bidding good-bye
to Lucy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep up your heart, my dear,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Things may
grow brighter for you some time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I got back, Mr. Eccles had nearly finished the sirloin, some
cheese, and a large tankard of ale. The Squire sat by, hospitably
pressing him to take more, whenever his knife and fork gave signs of
flagging. Tod stood looking on, his back against the mantelpiece.
Mrs. Todhetley soon appeared with a little cardboard box, where the
solitary earring was lying on a bed of wool.</p>

<p>Rising from the table, the detective carried the box to the window,
and stood there examining the earring; first in the box, then out of it.
He turned it about in his hand, and looked at it on all sides; it took
him a good three minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said he, breaking the silence, &ldquo;will you entrust this
earring to us for a day or two? It will be under Sergeant Cripp&rsquo;s
charge, and perfectly safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; interposed the Squire, before any one could
speak. &ldquo;You are welcome to take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, it is possible&mdash;indeed, most probable&mdash;that only one of us
may be able to obtain sight of the other earring. Should it be Cripp,
my having seen this one will be nearly useless to him. It is essential
that he should see it also: and it will not do to waste time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray take charge of it, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Todhetley, mentally recalling
what I had said of his errand to her and Lucy Bird. &ldquo;I know it will
be safe in your hands and Sergeant Cripp&rsquo;s. I am only too glad that
there is a probability of the other one being found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And look here,&rdquo; added the Squire to Eccles, while the latter
carefully wrapped the box in paper, and put it into his inner breast-pocket,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you and Cripp let that confounded gipsy escape. Have
her up and punish her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trust us for that,&rdquo; was the detective&rsquo;s answer, given with an
emphatic nod. &ldquo;<em>She is already as good as taken</em>, and her confederate
also. There&rsquo;s not a doubt&mdash;I avow it to you&mdash;that the other earring
is yours. We only wait to verify it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, with that, he buttoned his coat, and bowed himself out, the
Squire himself attending him to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is as much like a detective as I&rsquo;m like a Dutchman,&rdquo; commented
Tod. &ldquo;At least, according to what have been all my previous
notions of one. Live and learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He seems quite a polished man, has quite the manners of society,&rdquo;
added the mater. &ldquo;I do hope he will get back my poor earring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, is Lucy Bird in more trouble than usual?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is no doubt in deep distress of some kind, Johnny. But she
is never out of it. I wish Robert Ashton could induce her to leave
that most worthless husband of hers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire, after watching off the visitor, came in, rubbing his
hands and looking as delighted as old Punch. He assumed that the
earring was as good as restored, and was immensely taken with Mr.
Eccles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A most intelligent, superior man,&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;I suppose he is
what is called a gentleman-detective: he told me he had been to
college. I&rsquo;m sure it seems quite a condescension in him to work with
Cripp and the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the whole of tea-time and all the way to church, the praises
were being rung of Mr. Eccles. I&rsquo;m not sure but that he was more to
us that night than the sermon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I confess I feel mortified about that woman, though,&rdquo; confessed
Mrs. Todhetley. &ldquo;You heard him say that she was as good as taken:
they must have traced the earring to her. I did think she was one to
be trusted. How one may be deceived in people!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have trusted her with a twenty-pound note, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark at Johnny!&rdquo; cried Tod. &ldquo;This will be a lesson for you,
lad.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Monday morning. The Squire and Tod had gone over to South
Crabb. Mrs. Todhetley sat at the window, adding up some bills, her
nose red with the cold: and I was boxing Hugh&rsquo;s ears, for he was in
one of his frightfully troublesome moods, when Molly came stealing in
at the door, as covertly as if she had been committing murder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am! ma&rsquo;am!&mdash;there&rsquo;s that tramp in the yard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried the mater, turning round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I vow it&rsquo;s her; I know the old red shawl again,&rdquo; pursued Molly,
with as much importance as though she had caught half the thieves in
Christendom. &ldquo;She turned into the yard as bold as brass; so I just
slipped the bolt o&rsquo; the door against her, and come away. You&rsquo;ll have
her took up on the instant, ma&rsquo;am, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if she has come back, I don&rsquo;t think she can be guilty,&rdquo; cried
Mrs. Todhetley, after a bewildered pause. &ldquo;We had better see what
she wants. What do you say, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course we had. I&rsquo;ll go to her, as Molly&rsquo;s afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rushing out of hearing of Molly&rsquo;s vindictive answer, I went round
through the snow to the yard, and found the woman meekly tapping at
the kitchen-door&mdash;the old red shawl, and the black bonnet, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
white muslin cap border, all the same as before. Before I got quite
up, the kitchen-door was cautiously drawn open, and Mrs. Todhetley
looked out. The poor old woman dropped a curtsy and held out half-a-crown
on the palm of her withered hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made bold to call at the door to leave it, lady. And I can
never thank you enough, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; she added, the tears rising to her
eyes; &ldquo;my tongue would fail if I tried it. &rsquo;Tis not many as would
have trusted a stranger; and, that, a poor body like me. I got over to
Worcester quick and comfortable, ma&rsquo;am, thanks to you, and found my
daughter better nor I had hoped for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same feeling of reliance, of trust, arose within me as I saw her
face and heard her voice and words. If this woman was what they
had been fancying her, I&rsquo;d never eat tarts again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Mrs. Todhetley; and Molly, looking daggers as she
heard it, approached her mistress with a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, ma&rsquo;am. It&rsquo;s all a laid-out plan. She has heard that she&rsquo;s
suspected, and brings back the half-crown, thinking to put us off the
scent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Step this way,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Todhetley, giving no heed to Molly,
except by a nod&mdash;and she took the woman into the little store-room
where she kept her jam-pots and things, and bade her go to the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you tell me your name was,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;when you
were here on Friday?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nutt&rsquo;n, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nutten,&rdquo; repeated the mater, glancing at me. &ldquo;But I sent over to
Islip, and no one there knew anything about you&mdash;they denied that
any one of your name lived there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how could they do that?&rdquo; returned the woman, with every
appearance of surprise. &ldquo;They must have mistook somehow. I live
in the little cottage, ma&rsquo;am, by the dung-heap. I&rsquo;ve lived there for
five-and-twenty year, and brought up my children there, and never
had parish pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And gone always by the name of Nutten?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not never by no other, ma&rsquo;am. Why should I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was she to be believed? There was the half-crown in Mrs. Todhetley&rsquo;s
hand, and there was the honest wrinkled old face looking up
at us openly. But, on the other side, there was the assertion of the
Islip people; and there was the earring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the matter with your daughter, and in what part of
Worcester does she live?&rdquo; queried the mater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s second servant to a family in Melcheapen Street, ma&rsquo;am,
minds the children and does the beds, and answers the door, and that.
When I got there&mdash;and sick enough my heart felt all the way, thinking
what the matter could be&mdash;I found that she had fell from the parlour
window that she&rsquo;d got outside to clean, and broke her arm and scarred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
her face, and frighted and shook herself finely. But thankful enough I
was that &rsquo;twas no worse. Her father, ma&rsquo;am, died of an accident, and
I can never abear to hear tell of one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I lost an earring out of my ear that afternoon,&rdquo; said Mrs. Todhetley,
plunging into the matter, but not without hesitation. &ldquo;I think
I must have lost it just about the time I was talking to you. Did you
pick it up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, I didn&rsquo;t. I should have gave it to you if I had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not carry it off with you, I suppose!&rdquo; interrupted wrathful
Molly; who had come in to get some eggs, under pretence that the
batter-pudding was waiting for them.</p>

<p>And whether it was Molly&rsquo;s sharp and significant tone, or our silence
and looks, I don&rsquo;t know; but the woman saw it all then, and what she
was suspected of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am, were you thinking that ill of me?&rdquo;&mdash;and the hands
shook as they were raised, and the white border seemed to lift itself
from the horror-stricken face. &ldquo;Did you think I could do so ill a turn,
and after all the kindness showed me? The good Lord above knows
I&rsquo;m not a thief. Dear heart! I never set eyes, lady, on the thing
you&rsquo;ve lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am <em>sure</em> you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;I said so all along. It
might have dropped anywhere in the road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never see it, nor touched it, sir,&rdquo; she reiterated, the tears raining
down her cheeks. &ldquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am, do believe me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly tossed her head as she went out with the eggs in her apron;
but I would sooner have believed myself guilty than that poor woman.
Mrs. Todhetley thought with me. She offered her some warm ale and
a crust; but the old woman shook her head in refusal, and went off in
a fit of crying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She knows no more of the earring than I know of it, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel sure she does not, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Molly&rsquo;s getting unbearable. I wonder you don&rsquo;t send her
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has her good points, dear,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Todhetley. &ldquo;Only
think of her cooking! and of what a thrifty, careful manager she is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire and Tod got home for lunch. Nothing could come up
to their ridicule when they heard what had occurred, saying that the
mother and I were two muffs, fit to go about the world in a caravan as
specimens of credulity. Like Molly, they thought we ought to have
secured the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you see she was honest in the matter of the half-crown,&rdquo;
debated Mrs. Todhetley, in her mild way. &ldquo;She brought that back.
It does not stand to reason that she would have dared to come within
miles of the place, if she had taken the earring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s just the thing she would do,&rdquo; retorted the Squire, pacing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
about in a commotion. &ldquo;Once she had got rid of the earring, she&rsquo;d
show up here to throw suspicion off herself. And she couldn&rsquo;t come
without returning the half-crown: it must have gone nicely against the
grain to return <em>that</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Mrs. Todhetley, the most easily swayed spirit in the world,
began to veer round again like a weathercock, and fear we had been
foolish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should see her jagged-out old red shawl,&rdquo; cried Molly,
triumphantly. &ldquo;All the red a&rsquo;most washed out of it, and the edges in
tatters. <em>I</em> know a tramp when I sees one: and the worst of all tramps
is them that do the tricks with clean hands and snow-white cap-borders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The theme lasted us all the afternoon. I held my tongue, for it was
of no use contending against the stream. It was getting dusk when
Cole called in, on his way from the Coneys. The Squire laid the
grievance before him, demanding whether he had ever heard of two
people so simple as I and the mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did she say her name was?&rdquo; asked Cole. &ldquo;Nutten?&mdash;of
Islip? Are you sure she did not say Norton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said Nutt&rsquo;n. We interpreted it into Nutten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Johnny, that&rsquo;s how she would say it. I&rsquo;ll lay a guinea it&rsquo;s
old Granny Norton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Granny Norton!&rdquo; echoed the Squire. &ldquo;She is respectable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Respectable, honest, upright as the day,&rdquo; replied Cole. &ldquo;I have a
great respect for old Mrs. Norton. She&rsquo;s very poor now; but she was
not always so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She told us this morning that she lived in the cottage by the dung-heap,&rdquo;
I put in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly: she does so. And a nice dung-heap it is; the disgrace
of Islip,&rdquo; added Cole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you mean to say, Cole, that you know this woman&mdash;that she&rsquo;s
not a tramp, but Mrs. Norton?&rdquo; spoke the pater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know Mrs. Norton of Islip,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I saw her pass my
window this morning: she seemed to be coming from the railway-station.
It was no tramp, Squire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was she dressed?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Todhetley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dressed? Well, her shawl was red, and her bonnet black. I&rsquo;ve
never seen her dressed otherwise, when abroad, these ten years past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;has she a daughter in service at Worcester?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so. Yes, I am sure so. It&rsquo;s Susan. Oh, it is the
same person: you need not doubt it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what the deuce did Luke Macintosh mean by bringing word
back from Islip that she was not known there?&rdquo; fiercely demanded the
Squire, turning to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Luke said he asked for her by the name of Nutt&mdash;Mrs. Nutt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
I questioned him about it this afternoon, sir, and he said he understood
Nutt to have been the name we gave him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was very unsatisfactory as far as the earring went. (And we
ascertained later that poor Mrs. Norton <em>was</em> Mrs. Norton, and had been
suspected wrongly.) For, failing the tramp view of the case, who
could have sold the earring to the professional gentleman in Worcester?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cripp knows what he is about; never fear,&rdquo; observed the Squire.
&ldquo;Now that he has the case well in hand, he is sure to pull it successfully
through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you may trust Cripp,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;And I hope, Mrs.
Todhetley, you will soon be gladdened by the sight of your earring
again.&rdquo; And Cole went out, telling us we were going to have a thaw.
Which we could have told him, for it had already set in, and the snow
was melting rapidly.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>&ldquo;To think that I should have done so stupid a thing. But I have
been so flustered this morning by that parson and his nonsense that I
hardly know what I&rsquo;m about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speaker was Miss Timmens. She had come up in a passion,
after twelve o&rsquo;clock school. Not with us, or with her errand&mdash;which
was to bring one of the new shirts to show, made after Tod&rsquo;s fancy&mdash;but
with the young parson. Upon arriving and unfolding the said
shirt, Miss Timmens found that she had brought the wrong shirt&mdash;one
of those previously finished. The thaw had gone on so briskly in the
night that this morning the roads were all mud and slop, and Miss
Timmens had walked up in her pattens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is enough to make a saint swear, with his absurdities and his
rubbish,&rdquo; went on Miss Timmens, turning from the table where lay the
unfolded shirt, and speaking of the new parson; between whom and
herself hot war waged. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d never believe, ma&rsquo;am, what he did
this morning&rdquo;&mdash;facing Mrs. Todhetley. &ldquo;I had got the spelling-class
up, and the rest of the girls were at their slates and copies, and that,
when in he walked amidst the roomful. &lsquo;Miss Timmens,&rsquo; says he to
me, in the hearing of them all, &lsquo;I think these children should learn a
little music. And perhaps a little drawing might not come amiss to
those who have talent for it.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh yes, of course,&rsquo; says I, hardly able
to keep my temper, &lsquo;and a little dancing as well, and let &rsquo;em go out on
the green daily and step their figures to a fife and tambourine!&rsquo;
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like education,&rsquo; he goes on, staring hard at me, as if
he hardly knew whether to take my words for jest or earnest; &lsquo;and it
is well to unite, as far as we can, the ornamental with the useful, it
makes life pleasanter. It is quite right to teach girls to hem dusters
and darn stockings, but I think some fancy-work should be added to
it: embroidery and the like.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, you great baby!&rsquo; I thought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
myself, and did but just stop my tongue from saying it. &lsquo;Will
embroidery and music and drawing help these girls to scour floors, and
cook dinners, and wash petticoats?&rsquo; I asked him. &lsquo;If I had a set of
young ladies here, it would be right for them to learn accomplishments;
but these girls are to be servants. And all I can say, sir, is, that if
ever those new-fangled notions are introduced, you&rsquo;ll have to find
another mistress, for I&rsquo;ll not stop to help in it. It would just lead
many a girl to her ruin, sir; that&rsquo;s what it would do, whoever lives to
see it.&rsquo; Well, he went away with that, ma&rsquo;am, but he had put my
temper up&mdash;talking such dangerous nonsense before the girls, their ears
all agape to listen!&mdash;and when twelve o&rsquo;clock struck, I was not half
through the spelling-class! Altogether, it&rsquo;s no wonder I brought away
the wrong shirt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Timmens, her errand a failure, began folding up the shirt in a
bustle, her thin face quite fiery with anger. Mrs. Todhetley shook her
head; she did not approve of nonsensical notions for these poor peasant
girls any more than did the rest of us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring up the right shirt this evening when school&rsquo;s over; and
if it suits we&rsquo;ll get on with the rest,&rdquo; concluded Miss Timmens, making
her exit with the parcel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the world will come to later, Mr. Johnny, if these wild ideas
get much ground, puzzles me to think of,&rdquo; resumed Miss Timmens, as
I went with her, talking, along the garden-path. &ldquo;We shall have no
servants, sir; none. It does not stand to reason that a girl will work
for her bread at menial offices when she has had fine notions instilled
into her. Grammar, and geography, and history, and botany, and music,
and singing, and fancy-work!&mdash;what good will they be of to her in making
beds and cleaning saucepans? The upshot will be that they won&rsquo;t
make beds and they won&rsquo;t clean saucepans; they&rsquo;ll be above it. The
Lord protect &rsquo;em!&mdash;for I don&rsquo;t see what else will; or what will become
of them. Or of the world, either, when it can get no servants. My
goodness, Master Johnny! what&rsquo;s that? Surely it&rsquo;s the lost earring?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Close to the roots of a small fir-tree it lay: the earring that had
caused so much vexation and hunting. I picked it up: its pink topaz
and diamonds shone brightly as ever in the sun, and were quite
uninjured. Mrs. Todhetley remembered then, though it had slipped
her memory before, that in coming indoors after the interview with the
woman at the gate, she had stopped to shake this fir-tree, bowed down
almost to breaking with its weight of snow. The earring must have
fallen from her ear then into the snow, and been hidden by it.</p>

<p>Without giving himself time for a mouthful of lunch, the Squire tore
away to the station through the mud, as fast as his legs would carry
him, and thence to Worcester by train. What an unfortunate mistake
it would be should that professional gentleman have been accused, who
had bought something from the travelling pedlar!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Cripp, here&rsquo;s a fine discovery!&rdquo; panted the Squire, as he
went bursting into the police-station and to the presence of Sergeant
Cripp. &ldquo;The lost earring has turned up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I am very glad to hear it,&rdquo; said the sergeant, facing round
from a letter he was writing. &ldquo;How has it been found?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the Squire told him how.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not stolen at all, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all, Cripp. And the poor creature we suspected of taking
it proves to be a very respectable old body indeed, nothing of the
tramp about her. You&mdash;you have not gone any lengths yet with that
professional gentleman, I hope!&rdquo; added the Squire, dropping his voice
to a confidential tone.</p>

<p>Cripp paused for a minute, as if not understanding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have not employed any professional man at all in the matter,&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;have not thought of doing so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that, Cripp. <em>You</em> know. The gentleman you suspected
of having bought the earring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cripp stared. &ldquo;I have not suspected any one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness me! you need not be so cautious, Cripp,&rdquo; returned the
Squire, somewhat nettled. &ldquo;Eccles made a confidant of me. He told
me all about it&mdash;except the name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What Eccles?&rdquo; asked Cripp. &ldquo;I really do not know what you
are talking of, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What Eccles&mdash;why, your Eccles. Him you sent over to me on
Sunday afternoon: a well-dressed, gentlemanly man, with a black
moustache. Detective Eccles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know any Detective Eccles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, my good man, you must be losing your memory!&rdquo;
retorted the Squire, in wrath. &ldquo;He came straight to me from you on
Sunday; you sent him off in haste without his dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite a mistake, sir,&rdquo; said the sergeant. &ldquo;It was not I who sent
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, bless my heart and mind, Cripp, you&rsquo;ll be for telling me next
the sun never shone! Where&rsquo;s your recollection gone to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope my recollection is where it always has been, Squire. We
must be at cross-purposes. I do not know any one of the name of
Eccles, and I have not sent any one to you. As a proof that I could
not have done it, I may tell you, sir, that I was summoned to Gloucester
on business last Friday directly after I saw you, and did not get back
here until this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire rubbed his face, whilst he revolved probabilities, and
thought Cripp must be dreaming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He came direct from you&mdash;from yourself, Cripp; and he disclosed
to me your reasons for hoping you had found the earring, and your
doubts of the honesty of the man who had bought it&mdash;the lawyer, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
remember. And he brought back the other earring to you that you
might compare them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh&mdash;what?&rdquo; cried Cripp, briskly. &ldquo;Brought away the other
earring, do you say, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure he did. What else did you send him for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he has not returned it to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Returned it! of course not. You hold it, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Squire Todhetley, you have been cleverly robbed of this
second earring,&rdquo; cried Cripp, quietly. &ldquo;<em>Dodged</em> out of it, sir. The
man who went over to you must have been a member of the swell-mob.
Well-dressed, and a black moustache!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a college man, had been at Oxford,&rdquo; debated the unfortunate
pater, sitting on a chair in awful doubt. &ldquo;He told me so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not see him there, sir,&rdquo; said the sergeant, with a suppressed
laugh. &ldquo;I might tell you I had a duke for a grandmother; but it
would be none nearer the fact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercy upon us all!&rdquo; groaned the Squire. &ldquo;What a mortification
it will be if that other earring&rsquo;s gone! Don&rsquo;t you think some one in
your station here may have sent him, if you were out yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will inquire, for your satisfaction, Squire Todhetley,&rdquo; said the
sergeant, opening the door; &ldquo;but I can answer for it beforehand that
it will be useless.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was as Cripp thought. Eccles was not known at the station, and
no one had been sent to us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It all comes of that advertisement you put in, Squire,&rdquo; finished up
Cripp, by way of consolation. &ldquo;The swell-mob would not have known
there was a valuable jewel missing but for that, or the address of those
who had missed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pater came home more crestfallen than a whipped schoolboy,
after leaving stringent orders with Cripp and his men to track out the
swindler. It was a blow to all of us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said he looked as much like a detective as I&rsquo;m like a Dutchman,&rdquo;
quoth Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s frightfully mortifying,&rdquo; said the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the way he polished off that beef, and drank down the ale! I
wonder he did not contrive to walk off with the silver tankard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Joe! You are laughing, sir! Do you think it is a
laughing matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said bold Tod. &ldquo;It was cleverly done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Up rose the pater in a passion. Vowing vengeance against the
swindlers who went about the world, got up in good clothes and a
moustache; and heartily promising the absent and unconscious Cripp
to be down upon him if he did not speedily run the man to earth.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s how Mrs. Todhetley lost the other earring.</p>

<h2><span class="f9">IX.</span><br />

A TALE OF SIN.</h2>

<hr class="l7" />

<h3>Part the First.</h3>

<p>If I don&rsquo;t relate this quite as usual, and it is found to be different from
what I generally write, it is because I know less about it than others
know. The history is Duffham&rsquo;s; not mine. And there are diaries in
it, and all kinds of foreign things. That is, foreign to me. Duffham
holds all the papers, and has lent them to me to use. It came about
in this way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whilst you are picking up the sea-breezes, Johnny,&rdquo; he said, when
I called to tell him where I was going, &ldquo;you can be getting on with
another paper or two for us, I hope; for we like your stories.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am going away for a rest, Mr. Duffham; not to work. I
don&rsquo;t want to be ransacking memory for materials during any holiday,
and then weaving them into what you call a story. Much rest that
would be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the materials for one,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;plenty of them: it
won&rsquo;t take much weaving; you&rsquo;ll have it all before your eyes. It will
be nothing but play-work to you; just a bit of copying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t care to put fiction on paper and send it forth as though
it were true. What I tell of has mostly happened, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Duffham laughed a little. &ldquo;If everything told in print were as true
as this, Johnny Ludlow, the world would have witnessed some strange
events. Not that you&rsquo;ll find anything strange in this tale: it is quite
matter-of-fact. There&rsquo;s no romance about it; nothing but stern
reality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let me see the papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Duffham went out of the surgery, and came back with his spectacles
on, and carrying some papers tied up with pink tape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find a sort of narrative begun, Johnny,&rdquo; he said, untying the
tape, &ldquo;for I tried my own hand at it. But I found I could not get on
well. Writing manuscripts is not so much in my line as doctoring
patients.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, here&rsquo;s Lady Chavasse&rsquo;s name in it!&rdquo; I exclaimed, glancing
over the papers. &ldquo;Is it about <em>her</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see who it&rsquo;s about and who it&rsquo;s not about, Johnny,&rdquo; he
answered, rolling them up again. &ldquo;I should like you to retain the title
I have put to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the title?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Duffham undid the first sheet, and held it in silence for me to read.
&ldquo;A Tale of Sin.&rdquo; It took me aback. Sundry considerations naturally
struck me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Mr. Duffham, if it is about sin, and the people are still
living, how will they like to see it talked about in print?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You leave the responsibility to me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it on my
own shoulders. All you have to do is to put it into ship-shape,
Johnny. That is a matter of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so I took the papers. But the tale is Duffham&rsquo;s; not mine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To begin with, and make it explainable, we have to go ever so
many years back: but it won&rsquo;t be for long.</p>

<p>Duffham&rsquo;s predecessor as general practitioner at Church Dykely was
a Mr. Layne. Some of the poor would spell it without the &ldquo;y,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lane,&rdquo; but the other was the proper way. This Mr. Layne was of
rather good family, whilst his wife was only a small working farmer&rsquo;s
daughter. Mr. Layne lived in a pretty red-brick house, opposite to
Duffham&rsquo;s present residence. It stood a yard or two back from the
path, and had woodbines and jessamine creeping up its walls; the door
was in the middle, a window on each side; and there was a side-door
round the little garden-path, that opened into the surgery. The house
was his own.</p>

<p>Nearly a mile beyond the village, along the straight highway,
stood the gates and lodge of a fine place called Chavasse Grange,
belonging to Sir Peter Chavasse. He remained an old bachelor up to
nearly the end of his life. And then, when it seemed to be getting
time for him to prepare for the grave, he suddenly got married. The
young lady was a Miss Gertrude Cust: as might have been read in the
newspapers of the day, announcing the wedding.</p>

<p>But, when Sir Peter brought her home, the wonder to the neighbourhood
was, what could have induced the young lady to have him;
for she turned out to be a mere child in years, and very beautiful. It
was whispered that her family, high, poor, and haughty, had wished
her to make a different match; to a broken-down old nobleman, ten
times richer than Sir Peter; but that she hated the man. Sir Peter
had five thousand a-year, and his baronetcy was not of ancient
creation. The new lady was found to be very pleasant: she went into
the village often, and made acquaintance with everybody.</p>

<p>It was just about eight months after the marriage that Sir Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
died. The death was sudden. Mr. Layne was sent for in haste to the
Grange, and found he was too late. Too late for Sir Peter: but Lady
Chavasse, overcome with grief and terror, was in great need of his
services.</p>

<p>There was a baby expected at the Grange. Not yet: in three or
four months to come. And, until this child should be born, the
baronetcy had to lie in abeyance. If it proved to be a boy, he would
take his father&rsquo;s title and fortune; if a girl, both title and fortune
would lapse to some distant cousin; a young man, compared with Sir
Peter; who was in the navy, and was called Parker Chavasse.</p>

<p>And now we must give a line or two from one of the diaries I spoke
of. It is Mr. Layne&rsquo;s: and it appears to have been partly kept as a
professional note-book, partly as a private journal. At this time Mr.
Layne was a middle-aged man, with three young children, girls; he
had married later than some men do.</p>


<h4>[<i>From an Old Note-book of Mr. Layne&rsquo;s.</i>]</h4>

<p><i>May 18th.</i>&mdash;Have had a fatiguing day. Upon getting home from
my visit to Lady Chavasse, there were five different messages waiting
for me. It never rains but it pours. Ten o&rsquo;clock <span class="f8">P.M.</span>, and I am dead
tired; but I must write my notes before going to bed.</p>

<p>I wish I could get some strength and spirit into Lady Chavasse.
This listlessness tells sadly against her. Over and over again it has
been on the tip of my tongue to say it may go hard with her unless
she uses more exertion; but I don&rsquo;t like to frighten her. Nearly four
months now since Sir Peter died, and she has never been out but to
church&mdash;and to that she goes in the pony-carriage. &ldquo;My lady, you
ought to walk; my lady, you must walk,&rdquo; say I. And it is just as
though I spoke to the post at the lodge-gates.</p>

<p>I was much surprised by what she told me to-day&mdash;that there was
no settlement made on her at her marriage. &ldquo;Do you think my baby
will be a boy, Mr. Layne?&rdquo; she asked&mdash;as if it were possible for me to
tell! &ldquo;If it is not,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I shall have to turn out of my
home here, and I have not another to go to in the wide world.&rdquo;
And then it was, seeing my surprise, that she said there had been no
settlement. &ldquo;It was not my husband&rsquo;s intentional fault,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;and I will never have him blamed, come what will. Things
were unpleasant at my home, and we hurried on the marriage, he and
I, so that he might take me out of it, and there was no time to get a
settlement drawn up, even had we, either of us, thought of it, which
we did not.&rdquo; Listening to this, the notion struck me that it must have
been something like a runaway marriage; but I said nothing, only
bade her take heart and hope for a boy. &ldquo;I cannot imagine any lot
in life now so delightful as this would be&mdash;that I and my baby-boy
should live on in this charming place together&mdash;I training him always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
for good,&rdquo; she continued&mdash;and a faint pink came into her delicate
cheek as she said it, a yearning look into her hazel eyes. &ldquo;You
would help me to keep him in health and make him strong, would you
not, Mr. Layne?&rdquo; I answered that I would do my best. Poor
thing! she was only eighteen yesterday, she told me. I hope she&rsquo;ll
be able to keep the place; I hope it won&rsquo;t go over her head to rough
Parker Chavasse. And a rough-mannered man he is: I saw him once.</p>

<p>Coming home I met Thompson. The lawyer stopped, ever ready
for a chat. I spoke about this expected child, and the changes its
arrival might make. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite true that Lady Chavasse would have
to turn out,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Every individual shilling is entailed. Books,
plate, carriages&mdash;it all goes with the title. I&rsquo;m not sure but Sir Peter&rsquo;s
old clothes have to be thrown in too, so strict is the entail. No
settlement on her, you say, Layne? My good fellow, old Peter had
nothing to settle. He had spent his income regularly, and there lay
nothing beyond it. I&rsquo;ve heard that that was one of the reasons why
the Custs objected to the match.&rdquo; Well, it seemed a curious position:
I thought so as Thompson went off; but I don&rsquo;t understand law, and
can take his word for it. And now to bed. If&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s that? A carriage drawing up to the house, and the night-bell!
I am wanted somewhere as sure as a gun, and my night&rsquo;s rest
is stopped, I suppose. Who&rsquo;d be a doctor? Listen! There&rsquo;s my
wife opening the street-door. What does she call out to me? Lady
Chavasse not well? A carriage waiting to take me to the Grange?
Thank fortune at least that I have not to walk there.</p>

<p><i>May 22nd.</i>&mdash;Four days, and nothing noted down. But I have been
very busy, what with Lady Chavasse and other patients. The doubt
is over, and over well. The little child is a boy, and a nice little
fellow, too; healthy, and likely to live. He was born on the 20th.
Lady Chavasse, in her gladness, says she shall get well all one way.
I think she will: the mind strangely influences the body. But my
lady is a little hard&mdash;what some might call unforgiving. Her mother
came very many miles, posting across country, to see her and be
reconciled, and Lady Chavasse refused to receive her. Mrs. Cust had
to go back again as she came. I should not like to see my wife treat
her mother so.</p>

<p><i>May 30th.</i>&mdash;The child is to be named Geoffry Arthur. Sir Peter
had a dislike to his own name, and had said he hoped never to call a
boy of his by the same. Lady Chavasse, mindful of his every wish,
has fixed on the other two. I asked her if they were the names of
relatives: she laughed and said, No; she chose them because she
thought them both nice-sounding and noble names.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The above is all that need be copied from Mr. Layne: one has to
be chary of space. Little Sir Geoffry grew and thrived: and it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
pleasure, people say, to see how happy his mother and he were, and
how she devoted herself to him. He had come to her in the midst of
her desolation, when she had nothing else to care for in life. It was
already seen that he would be much like his father, who had been a
very good-looking man in his day. Little Geoffry had Sir Peter&rsquo;s
fair complexion and his dark-blue eyes. He was a sweet, tractable
child; and Lady Chavasse thought him just an angel come down from
heaven.</p>

<p>Time went on. When Geoffry was about seven years old&mdash;and a
very pretty boy, with fair curls&mdash;he went out surreptitiously on a
fishing expedition, fell into the pond, and was nearly drowned. It left
a severe cold upon him, which his nurse, Wilkins, said served him
right. However, from that time he seemed to be less strong; and at
length Lady Chavasse took him to London to show him to the doctors.
The doctors told her he ought to be, for a time, in a warmer climate:
and she went with him into Devonshire. But he still kept delicate.
And the upshot was that Lady Chavasse let the Grange for a long
term to the Goldingham family, and went away.</p>

<p>And so, many years passed. The Goldinghams lived on at the
Grange: and Lady Chavasse nearly slipped out of remembrance.
Mr. Layne fell into ill health as he grew older, and advertised for a
partner. It was Duffham who answered it (a youngish man then) and
they went into arrangements.</p>

<p>It is necessary to say something of Mr. Layne&rsquo;s children. There
were four of them, girls. The eldest, Susan, married a Lieutenant
Layne (some distant relative, who came from the West Indies), and
went with him to India, where his regiment was serving, taking also
her next sister, Eleanor. The third, Elizabeth, was at home; the
young one, Mary, born several years after the others, was in a school
as governess-pupil, or under-teacher. It is not often that village
practitioners can save money, let alone make a fortune.</p>

<p>The next thing was, that Mr. Layne died. His death made all the
difference to his family. Mr. Duffham succeeded to the practice; by
arrangement he was to pay something yearly for five years to Mrs.
Layne; and she had a small income of her own. She would not quit
the house; it was hers now her husband was gone. Mr. Duffham took
one opposite: a tall house, with a bow-window to the parlour: before
that, he had been in apartments. Mary Layne came home about this
time, and stayed there for some weeks. She had been much overworked
in the school, and Mrs. Layne thought she required rest. She
was a pleasing girl, with soft brown eyes and a nice face, and was very
good and gentle; thinking always of others, never of self. Old Duffham
may choose to deny it now he&rsquo;s grown older, but he thought her superior
then to the whole world.</p>

<p>Matters were in this state when news spread that the Goldinghams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
had received notice to quit the Grange: Sir Geoffry, who would be of
age the following year, was coming home to it with his mother. Accordingly
the Goldinghams departed; and the place was re-embellished
and put in order for the rightful owner. He arrived in April with Lady
Chavasse: and I&rsquo;ll copy for you what Duffham says about it. Mr.
Layne had then been dead about two years.</p>


<h4>[<i>From Mr. Duffham&rsquo;s Diary.</i>]</h4>

<p><i>April 29th.</i>&mdash;The new people&mdash;or I suppose I ought to say the old
people&mdash;reached the Grange yesterday, and I was called in to-day to the
lady&rsquo;s-maid&mdash;Wilkins. My lady I don&rsquo;t like; Sir Geoffry I do. He
is a good-looking, slight young man of middle height, with a fair refined
face and honest eyes, blue as they tell me Sir Peter&rsquo;s used to be. An
honourable, well-intentioned young fellow I am sure; affable and considerate
as his mother is haughty. Poor Layne used to cry her up; he
thought great things of her. I do not. It may be that power has
made her selfish, and foreign travel imperious; but she&rsquo;s both selfish
and imperious now. She is nice-looking still; and though she wants
but a year of forty, and her son is only one-and-twenty, they are almost
like brother and sister. Or would be, but for Sir Geoffry&rsquo;s exceeding
consideration for his mother; his love and deference for her are a
pattern to the young men of the present day. She has trained him to
be obedient, that&rsquo;s certain, and to love her too: and so I suppose she
has done her duty by him well. He came down the broad walk with
me from the hall-door, talking of his mother: I had happened to say
that the place must seem quite strange to Lady Chavasse. &ldquo;Yes, it
must,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;She has exiled herself from it for my sake.
Mr. Duffham,&rdquo; he continued warmly, &ldquo;you cannot imagine what an
admirable mother mine has been! She resigned ease, rest, society, to
devote herself to me. She gave me a home-tutor, that she might herself
watch over and train me; she went to and fro between England
and foreign places with me everlastingly; even when I was at Oxford,
she took a house a mile or two out, that we might not be quite separated.
I pray Heaven constantly that I may never cross her in thought, word,
or deed: but live only to repay her love.&rdquo; Rather Utopian this: but
I honour the young fellow for it. I&rsquo;ve only seen him for an hour at
most, and am already wishing there were more like him in the world.
If his mother has faults, he does not see them; he will never honour
any other woman as he honours her. A contrast, this, to the contempt,
ingratitude, and disrespect that some sons think it manly to show their
best and truest earthly parent.</p>

<p>My lady is vexed, I can see, at this inopportune illness of her maid&rsquo;s;
for the Grange is all upside down with the preparations for the grand
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> to be held on the 20th of next month, when Sir Geoffry will come
of age. Wilkins has been in the family for many years: she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
originally the boy&rsquo;s nurse: and is quite the right hand of Lady
Chavasse, so far as household management goes. Her illness just now
<em>is</em> inopportune.</p>


<h4>[<i>End, for the present, of Mr. Duffham&rsquo;s Diary.</i>]</h4>

<p>Nothing was talked of, in the village or out of it, but the grand
doings that were to usher in the majority of Sir Geoffry. As to Lady
Chavasse, few people had seen her. Her maid&rsquo;s illness, as was supposed,
kept her indoors; and some of the guests were already arriving
at the Grange.</p>

<p>One morning, when it wanted about a week to the 20th, Mrs. Layne,
making a pillow-case at her parlour window, in her widow&rsquo;s cap and
spectacles, with the Venetian blind open to get all the light she could,
was startled by seeing Lady Chavasse&rsquo;s barouche draw up to her door,
and Lady Chavasse preparing to descend from it. Mrs. Layne
instinctively rose, as to a superior, and took her glasses off: it has been
said she was of a humble turn: and upon Lady Chavasse fixing her
eyes upon her in what seemed some surprise, dropped a curtsy, and
thought to herself how fortunate it was she happened to have put a
clean new cap on. With that, Lady Chavasse said something to the
footman, who banged the carriage-door to, and ordered the coachman
across the road. Mrs. Layne understood it at once: she had come to
the house in mistake for Duffham&rsquo;s. Of course, with that grand
carriage to look at opposite, and the gorgeous servants, and my lady,
in a violet velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, alighting and stepping
in to Duffham&rsquo;s, Mrs. Layne let fall her pillow-case, and did no more
of it. But she was not prepared, when Lady Chavasse came out again
with Mr. Duffham, to see him escort her over the road to her gate.
Mrs. Layne had just time to open her parlour-door, and say to the
servant, &ldquo;In the other room: show her ladyship into the other room,&rdquo;
before she went off into complete bewilderment, and ran away with the
pillow-case.</p>

<p>The other room was the best room. Mary Layne sat there at the old
piano, practising. She had seen and heard nothing of all this; and
rose in astonishment when the invasion took place. A beautiful lady,
whom Mary did not know or recognize, was holding out a delicately-gloved
hand to her, and saying that she resembled her father. It was
Mary Layne&rsquo;s first meeting with Lady Chavasse: she had just come
home again from some heavy place of teaching, finding her strength
unequal to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have known you, I think, for a daughter of Mr. Layne&rsquo;s
had I met you in the street,&rdquo; said Lady Chavasse, graciously.</p>

<p>Mary was blushing like anything. Lady Chavasse thought her an
elegant girl, in spite of the shabby black silk she was dressed in: very
pretty too. At least, it was a nice countenance; and my lady quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
took to it. Mrs. Layne, having collected her wits, and taken off her
apron, came in then: and Mary, who was humble-minded also, though
not exactly in the same way that her mother was, modestly retired.</p>

<p>My lady was all graciousness: just as much so that morning as she
used to be. Perhaps the sight of Mrs. Layne put her in mind of the
old days when she was herself suffering trouble in a widow&rsquo;s cap, and
not knowing how matters would turn out for her, or how they would
not. She told Mrs. Layne that she had, unthinkingly, bid her servants
that morning drive to <em>Mr. Layne&rsquo;s!</em> and it was only when she saw
Mrs. Layne at the window in her widow&rsquo;s cap, that she remembered
the mistake. She talked of her son Geoffry, praising his worth and his
goodness; she bade Mrs. Layne to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> on the 20th, saying she
must come and bring her two daughters, and she would take no denial.
And Mrs. Layne, curtsying again&mdash;which did not become her, for she
was short and stout&mdash;opened the front-door to her ladyship with her own
hands, and stood there curtsying until the carriage had dashed away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go on the 20th,&rdquo; she said to her daughters. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like
to say nay to her ladyship; and I should be glad to see what the young
heir&rsquo;s like. He was as pretty a boy as you&rsquo;d wish to see. There&rsquo;ll no
doubt be some people there of our own condition that we can mix with,
and it will be in the open air: so we shan&rsquo;t feel strange.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when the day arrived, and they had reached the Grange, it seemed
that they felt very strange. Whether amidst the crowds they did not
find any of their &ldquo;own condition,&rdquo; or that none were there, Mrs. Layne
did not know. Once, they came near Lady Chavasse. Lady Chavasse,
surrounded by a bevy of people that Mrs. Layne took to be lords and
ladies&mdash;and perhaps she was right&mdash;bowed distantly, and waved her
hand, as much as to say, &ldquo;Make yourselves at home, but don&rsquo;t trouble
me:&rdquo; and Mrs. Layne curtsyed herself to a respectful distance. It was
a fine bright day, very warm; and she sat on a bench in the park with
her daughters, listening to the band, looking at the company, and wondering
which was the heir. Some hours seemed to pass in this way, and
gradually the grounds grew deserted. People were eating and drinking
in a distant tent&mdash;the lords and ladies Mrs. Layne supposed, and she
did not presume to venture amongst them. Presently a young man
approached, who had observed from a distance the solitary group. A
fat old lady in widow&rsquo;s mourning; and the younger ones in pretty
white bonnets and new black silks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you allow me to take you where you will find some refreshment?&rdquo;
he said, raising his hat, and addressing Mrs. Layne.</p>

<p>She paused before answering, taken aback by his looks, as she
described it afterwards, for he put her in mind of Sir Peter. It was as
nice a face as Sir Peter&rsquo;s used to be, clean-shaved, except for the light
whiskers: and if those were not Sir Peter&rsquo;s kindly blue eyes, why, her
memory failed her. But the dress puzzled Mrs. Layne: he wore a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
dark-blue frock-coat and grey trousers, a white waistcoat with a thin
gold chain passed across it and a drooping seal: all very nice and
gentlemanly certainly, but quite plain. What she had expected to see
the heir attired in, Mrs. Layne never afterwards settled with herself:
perhaps purple and miniver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon sir,&rdquo; she said, speaking at length, &ldquo;but I think
you must be Sir Geoffry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am Sir Geoffry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord bless me!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Layne.</p>

<p>She told him who she was, adding, as an apology for being found
there, that her ladyship had invited her and her girls, and wouldn&rsquo;t
take a denial. Geoffry held out his arm cordially to lead her to the
tent, and glanced behind at the &ldquo;girls,&rdquo; remembering what his mother
had said to him of one of them: &ldquo;a sweet-looking young woman,
Geoffry, poor Layne&rsquo;s daughter, quite an elegant girl.&rdquo; Yes, she was
sweet-looking and elegant also, Geoffry decided. The elder one was
like her mother, short, stout, and&mdash;Geoffry could not help seeing it&mdash;commonplace.
He told Mrs. Layne that he could remember her
husband still: he spoke of a ride the doctor had taken him, seated
before him on his horse; and altogether in that short minute or two
won, by his true affability, the heart of the doctor&rsquo;s widow.</p>

<p>The tent was crowded to confusion. Waiters were running about,
and there was much rattle of knives and forks. Sir Geoffry could find
only two places anywhere; at which he seated Mrs. Layne and her
daughter Elizabeth, according to precedence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will find you a place in the other tent, if you will come with me,&rdquo;
he said to Mary.</p>

<p>She wished to refuse. She had a suspicion that the other tent was
the one for the &ldquo;lords and ladies,&rdquo; people who were altogether above
her. But Sir Geoffry was holding up the canvas for her to pass out,
and she was too timid to disobey. He walked by her side almost in
silence, speaking a courteous word or two only, to put her at her ease.
The band was playing &ldquo;The Roast Beef of Old England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the other tent seemed in worse confusion as far as crowding
went. Some one turned on her seat to accost Sir Geoffry: a slight,
upright girl, with finely-carved features of that creamy white rarely
seen, and a haughty expression in her very light eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are being waited for, Geoffry. Don&rsquo;t you know that you
preside?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; nonsense!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s to be nothing of that sort,
Rachel; no presiding. I am going to walk about and look out for
stray people. Some of the strangers will get nothing, if they are not
seen after. Could you make room for one by you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Sir Geoffry said a word in her ear, and she moved a few inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
higher up. He stepped back to Mary Layne. She had been looking
at the young lady, who was so richly dressed&mdash;in some thin material of
shimmering blue and lace&mdash;and who was so utterly at her ease as to be
sitting without her bonnet, which she had put at her feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have made a place for you,&rdquo; said Sir Geoffry. &ldquo;I fear you
will be a little crowded. Miss Layne, Rachel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary waited to thank him before taking it. Her cheeks were full of
blushes, her soft dark eyes went out to his. She felt ashamed that
he should take so much trouble for her, and strove to say so. Sir
Geoffry held her hand while he answered, his own eyes looking back
again.</p>

<p>But Mary sat for some minutes before any one came to wait on her.
The young lady whom Sir Geoffry had called Rachel was busy with
her own plate, and did not observe. Presently, she looked round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me! what are they about? Field!&rdquo; she imperatively called
to the butler, who was passing. He turned at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have the goodness to attend here,&rdquo; said Lady Rachel, indicating
the vacant space before Miss Layne. &ldquo;This young lady has had
nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I really am amidst the lords and ladies,&rdquo; thought Mary, as the
butler presented her with a card of the dishes, made out in French,
and inquired what she would be pleased to take. She was inexperienced
and shy; and did not know where to look or what to say.
Lady Rachel spoke to her once or twice, and was civilly distant: and
so the half-hour was got over. When Sir Geoffry&rsquo;s health was proposed
by Lord L., the young baronet suddenly appeared in his rightful place
at the head of the table. He thanked them all very heartily in a few
words; and said he hoped he <em>should</em> live long, as they had all just been
wishing him, live that he might repay his dear mother one tithe of the
sacrifices she had made, and the love she had lavished on him.</p>

<p>The cheers broke forth as he finished, his eyes wet with the sincerity
of his feeling, the music burst out with a crash, &ldquo;See the conquering
hero comes,&rdquo; and Mary Layne felt every nerve thrill within her; as if
she would faint with the excess of unwonted emotion.</p>


<h4>[<i>Mr. Duffham&rsquo;s Diary.</i>]</h4>

<p><i>June 2nd.</i>&mdash;The rejoicings are well over, and Sir Geoffry Chavasse is
his own master. In law, at any rate; but it strikes me he will never
know any will but his mother&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s not that he possesses none of his
own&mdash;rather the contrary, I fancy; but in his filial love and reverence
he merges it in hers. It is, on the one hand, good to see; on the
other, one can but fancy his ideal of the fifth commandment is somewhat
exaggerated. Lady Chavasse on her part seems bound up in him.
To him there is no sign of imperiousness, no assertion of self-will: and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
so far as can be seen, she does not <em>exact</em> deference. &ldquo;Geoffry, would
you wish this?&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Geoffry, would you like the other? My
darling Geoffry, don&rsquo;t you think it might be well to do so-and-so?&rdquo;
No. It is a case of genuine filial respect and love; and one can but
honour Lady Chavasse for have gained it.</p>

<p>My lady has condescended to be almost confidential with me. The
illness of her maid has been a long and serious one, and I have had to
be a good deal at the Grange. &ldquo;Sir Geoffry is engaged to be married,
Mr. Duffham,&rdquo; she said to me yesterday, when our conversation had
turned&mdash;as it often does turn&mdash;on Sir Geoffry. I could not help showing
some surprise: and, one word leading to another, I soon grasped the
whole case. Not so much by what she directly said, as by the habit I
have of putting two-and-two together.</p>

<p>Conspicuous amidst the guests at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> on the 20th of May, was
Lady Rachel Derreston: a cold, self-possessed girl, with strictly classical
features, and the palest blue eyes I ever saw. It would be a very
handsome face&mdash;and indeed <em>is</em> so&mdash;but for its cold, proud expression;
she is the daughter of one of Lady Chavasse&rsquo;s sisters, who married the
Earl of Derreston, and is now a very slenderly-portioned widow with
some expensive daughters. It is to this Lady Rachel that Sir Geoffry
is engaged. The engagement is not of his own seeking, or of hers;
the two mothers settled it between them when the children were
young; they have been brought up to look on each other as future
husband and wife, and have done so as a matter-of-course. Neither of
them, by what I can gather, has the slightest intention, or wish, to turn
aside from fulfilling the contract: they will ratify it in just the same
business manner and with the same calm feelings that they would take
the lease of a house. It is not their fault: they should not have been
led into it. Human nature is cross and contrary as a crab: had the
two young people been thrown together now for the first time, and
been warned <em>not</em> to fall in love with each other, the chances are they
would have tumbled headlong into it before the week was out: as it
is, they like each other as cousins, or brother and sister, but they&rsquo;ll
never get beyond that. <em>I</em> can see. The two old sisters have a private
understanding with each other&mdash;and my young Lady Rachel dutifully
falls in with it&mdash;that after the marriage Lady Chavasse shall still live
and rule at the Grange. Indeed she implied it when she let fall the
words, perhaps unthinkingly&mdash;&ldquo;Geoffry would never marry to put me
out of my home here, Mr. Duffham.&rdquo; And I am sure that he never
would.</p>

<p>Lady Rachel is here still. I often see her and Sir Geoffry together,
indoors or out; but I have never yet seen a symptom of courtship on
either side. They call each other &ldquo;Geoffry&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rachel;&rdquo; and are
as indifferently familiar as brother and sister. That they will be
sufficiently happy with a quiet, moonlight kind of happiness, is almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
sure. I find that I am not at liberty to mention this engagement
abroad: and that&rsquo;s why I say my lady has grown confidential with
me.</p>

<p><i>June 29th.</i>&mdash;Wilkins continues very ill; and it puts my lady about
amazingly. The maid who has been taking Wilkins&rsquo;s duties, Hester
Picker, is a country girl of the locality, Goody Picker&rsquo;s daughter; her
services being as different from those of the easy, experienced Wilkins,
as darkness is from light. &ldquo;She manages my hair atrociously,&rdquo; cried
my lady to me, one day, in her vexation; &ldquo;she attempted to write a
note for me in answer to inquiries for the character of my late page,
and the spelling was so bad it could not be sent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Rachel has left. Sir Geoffry escorted her to her home (near
Bath), stayed two days there, and came back again. And glad to be
back, evidently: he does not care to be long separated from his mother.
The more I see of this young fellow, the more I like him. He has no
bad habits; does not smoke or swear: reads, rides, drives, loves
flowers, and is ever ready to do a good turn for rich or poor. &ldquo;You
appear to have grown up quite strong, Sir Geoffry,&rdquo; I said to him to-day
when we were in the greenhouse, and he leaped on a ledge to do
something or other to the broken cord of the window. &ldquo;Oh, quite,&rdquo;
he answered. &ldquo;I think I am stronger and heartier than most men:
and I owe thanks for it to my mother. It was not only my health of
body she cared for and watched over, but of mind. She taught me to
love rational pursuits; she showed me how to choose the good, and
reject the evil: it is she alone who has made me what I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>July 5th.</i>&mdash;Mary Layne is going to the Grange as companion to
Lady Chavasse. &ldquo;Humble companion,&rdquo; as my lady takes care to put
it. It has been brought about in this way. Wilkins is slightly improving:
but it will be months before she can resume her duties about
Lady Chavasse: and my lady has at length got this opinion out of me.
&ldquo;Five or six months!&rdquo; she exclaimed in dismay. &ldquo;But it is only
what I have lately suspected. Mr. Duffham, I have been thinking that
I must take a companion; and now this has confirmed it. A humble
companion, who will not object to do my hair on state occasions, and
superintend Picker in trimming my dresses, especially the lace; and
who will write notes for me when I desire it, and read to me when Sir
Geoffry&rsquo;s not here; and sit with me if I wish it. She wouldn&rsquo;t dine
with us, of course; but I might sometimes let her sit down to luncheon.
In short, what I want is a well-educated, lady-like young woman, who
will make herself useful. Do you happen to know of one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I mentioned Mary Layne. She has been wishing not to return to
the heavy work and confinement of a school, where she had to sit up
late, night after night, correcting exercises, and touching up drawings
by gas-light. My lady caught at it at once. &ldquo;Mary Layne! the very
thing. I like the look of the girl much, Mr. Duffham; and of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
she won&rsquo;t be above doing anything required of her: Layne, the
apothecary&rsquo;s daughter, cannot be called a gentlewoman in position,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She forgot I was an apothecary also; I&rsquo;ll give her that credit.
But this is a specimen of the way my lady&rsquo;s exclusive spirit peeps
out.</p>

<p>And so it is settled. And if Miss Mary had been suddenly offered
a position in the Royal household, she could not have thought more of
it. &ldquo;Mr. Duffham, I will try my very best to satisfy Lady Chavasse,&rdquo;
says she to me, in an ecstasy; &ldquo;I will do anything and everything
required of me: who am I, that I should be above it?&rdquo; And by the
glistening of her sweet brown eyes, and the rose-blush on her cheeks,
it would seem that she fancies she is going into fairy-land. Well, the
Grange is a nice place: and she is to have thirty guineas a-year. At
the last school she had twenty pounds: at the first ten.</p>


<h4>[<i>End of the Diary for the present.</i>]</h4>

<p>Miss Layne entered the Grange with trepidation. She had never
been inside the house, and at first thought it was fairy-land realized
and that she was out of place in it. A broad flight of three or four
steps led up to the wide entrance-door; the brilliant colours from the
painted windows shone on the mosaic pavement of the hall; on the
right were the grand drawing-rooms; on the left the dining-room and
Sir Geoffry&rsquo;s library. Behind the library, going down a step or two
was a low, shady apartment, its glass doors opening to a small grass
plat, round which flowers were planted; and beyond it lay the fragrant
herbary. This little room was called the garden-room; and on the
morning of Miss Layne&rsquo;s arrival, after she had taken off her things,
Hester Picker (who thought almost as much of the old surgeon&rsquo;s
daughter as she did of my lady) curtsyed her into it, and said it
was to be Miss Layne&rsquo;s sitting-room, when she was not with my
lady.</p>

<p>Mary Layne looked around. She thought it charming. It had an
old Turkey carpet, and faded red chairs, and a shabby checked cloth
on the table, with other ancient furniture; but the subdued light was
grateful after the garish July sun, and a sweetness came in from the
herbs and flowers. Mary stood, wondering what she had to do first,
and not quite daring to sit down even on one of the old red chairs.
The Grange was the Grange, and my lady was my lady; and they
were altogether above the sphere in which she had been brought up.
She had a new lilac muslin dress on, fresh and simple; her smooth
brown hair had a bit of lilac ribbon in it; and she looked as pretty and
ladylike as a girl can look. Standing at the back, there beyond the
able, was she, when Sir Geoffry walked in at the glass doors, his light
summer coat thrown back, and a heap of small paper packets in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
hands, containing seeds. At first he looked astonished: not remembering
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon!&rdquo; he exclaimed, his face lighting up, as he
took off his straw hat. &ldquo;Miss Mary Layne, I think. I did not know
you at the moment. My mother said she expected you to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came round to her with outstretched hand, and then put a chair
for her, just as though she had been a duchess&mdash;or Lady Rachel
Derreston. Mary did not take the chair: she felt strange in her new
home, and as yet very timid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not sure what Lady Chavasse would wish me to do,&rdquo; she
ventured to say, believing it might be looked upon as next door to a
crime to be seen idle, in a place where she was to receive thirty guineas
a-year. &ldquo;There appears to be no work here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get a book, and read!&rdquo; cried Sir Geoffry. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find you one as
soon as I have put up these seeds. A box of new novels has just come
from town. I hope you will make yourself at home with us, and be
happy,&rdquo; he added, in his kindness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir; I am sure I shall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was putting up the seeds, when Lady Chavasse entered. She
had a way of taking likes and dislikes, and she never scrupled to show
either. On this first day, it seemed that she did not know how to make
enough of Mary. She chose to forget that she was only to be the
humble companion, and treated her as a guest. She carried her in to
take luncheon with herself and Sir Geoffry; she made her play and
sing; she showed her the drawing-rooms and the flower-gardens, and
finally took her out in the barouche. She certainly did not ask her in
to dinner, but said she should expect her to come to the drawing-room
afterwards, and spend the evening. And Miss Layne, not ignorant of
the customs obtaining in great houses, dressed herself for it in her one
evening dress of white spotted muslin, and changed the lilac ribbon in
her hair for blue.</p>

<p>So that, you perceive, the girl was inaugurated at the Grange as a
young lady, almost as an equal, and not as a servant&mdash;as Lady
Chavasse&rsquo;s true opinion would have classed her. That was mistake
the first. For it led Sir Geoffry to make a companion of Miss Layne;
that is, to treat her as though she belonged to their order; which
otherwise he certainly would not have done. Had Miss Layne been
assigned her true place at first&mdash;the place that Lady Chavasse meant
her to fill, that of an inferior and humble dependent&mdash;Sir Geoffry, out
of simple respect to the girl and to his mother, would have kept his
distance.</p>

<p>As the time passed on they grew great friends. Lady Chavasse
retained her liking for Mary, and saw no harm in the growing intimacy
with Sir Geoffry. That was mistake the second. Both of them were
drifting into love; but Lady Chavasse dreamt it not. The social gulf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
that spread itself between Sir Geoffry Chavasse, of Chavasse Grange,
and Mary Layne, daughter of the late hard-worked village apothecary,
was one that Lady Chavasse would have said (had she been asked to
think about it) could never be bridged over: and for this very reason
she saw no danger in the intercourse. She regarded Mary Layne as
of a totally different caste from themselves, and never supposed but Sir
Geoffry did so too.</p>

<p>And so time went on, on the wings of love. There were garden
walks together and moonlight saunterings; meetings in my lady&rsquo;s
presence, meetings without it. Sir Geoffry, going in and out of the
garden-parlour at will, as he had been accustomed to do&mdash;for it was
where all kinds of things belonging to him were kept: choice seeds, his
fishing-rods, his collection of butterflies&mdash;would linger there by the hour
together, talking to Mary at her work. And, before either of them was
conscious of the danger, they had each passed into a dream that
changed everything about them to Paradise.</p>

<p>Of course, Sir Geoffry, when he awoke to the truth&mdash;that it was love&mdash;ought
to have gone away, or have contrived to get his mother to
dismiss Miss Layne. He did nothing of the sort. And for this, some
people&mdash;Duffham for one&mdash;held him even more to blame than for anything
that happened afterwards. But how could he voluntarily blight
his new happiness, and hers? It was so intense as to absorb every
other feeling; it took his common sense away from him. And thus
they went dreaming on together in that one spring-time (of the heart,
not of the weather), and never thought about drifting into shoals and
pitfalls.</p>

<p>In the autumn my lady went to the seaside in Cornwall, taking Mary
<em>as her maid</em>, and escorted by her son. &ldquo;Will you do for me what
I want while I am away? I do not care to be troubled with Picker,&rdquo;
she had said; and Mary replied, as in duty bound, that she would. It
is inconvenient to treat a maid as a lady, especially in a strange place,
and Mary found that during this sojourn Lady Chavasse did not attempt
it. To all intents and purposes Mary was the maid now; she did not
sit with her lady, she took her meals apart; she was, in fact, regarded
as the lady&rsquo;s-maid by all, and nothing else. Lady Chavasse even took
to calling her &ldquo;Layne.&rdquo; This, the sudden dethroning of her social
status, was the third mistake; and this one, as the first, was my lady&rsquo;s.
Sir Geoffry had been led to regard her as a companion; now he saw
her but as a servant. But, servant or no servant, you cannot put love
out of the heart, once it has possession of it.</p>

<p>At the month&rsquo;s end they returned home: and there Mary found that
she was to retain this lower station: never again would she be exalted
as she had been. Lady Chavasse had tired of the new toy, and just
carelessly allowed her to find her own level. Except that Miss Layne
sat in the garden-parlour, and her meals were served there, she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
not very much distinguished from Hester Picker and the other servants;
indeed, Picker sometimes sat in the parlour too, when they had lace,
or what not, to mend for my lady. Geoffry in his heart was grieved at
the changed treatment of Miss Layne; he thought it wrong and unjust;
and to make up for the mistake, was with her a great deal himself.</p>

<p>Things were in this position when Lady Chavasse was summoned to
Bath: her sister, Lady Derreston, was taken ill. Sir Geoffry escorted
her thither. Picker was taken, not Miss Layne. In the countess&rsquo;s
small household, Mary, in her anomalous position&mdash;for she could not
be altogether put with the servants&mdash;would have been an inconvenience;
and my lady bade her make herself happy at the Grange, and left her
a lot of fine needlework to get through.</p>

<p>Leaving his mother in Bath, Sir Geoffry went to London, stayed a
week or so, and then came back to the Grange. Another week or two,
and he returned to Bath to bring his mother home. And so the winter
set in, and wore on. And now all that has to be told to the paper&rsquo;s
end is taken from diaries, Duffham&rsquo;s and others. But for convenience&rsquo;
sake, I put it as though the words were my own, instead of copying
them literally.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Spring came in early. February was not quite at an end, and the
trees were beginning to show their green. All the month it had been
warm weather; but people said it was too relaxing for the season, and
they and the trees should suffer for it later. A good deal of sickness
was going about; and, amongst others who had to give in for a time,
was Duffham himself. He had inflammation of the lungs. His brother
Luke, who was partner in a medical firm elsewhere, came to Church
Dykely for a week or two, to take the patients. Luke was a plain-speaking
man of forty, with rough hair and a good heart.</p>

<p>The afternoon after he arrived, an applicant came into the surgery
with her daughter. It was Mrs. Layne, but the temporary doctor did
not know her. Mrs. Layne never did look like a lady, and he did not
mistake her for one: he thought it some respectable countrywoman:
she had flung a very ancient cloak over her worn morning gown. She
expressed herself disappointed at not seeing Mr. Duffham, but opened
the consultation with the brother instead. Mrs. Layne took it for
granted she was known, and talked accordingly.</p>

<p>Her daughter, whom she kept calling Mary, and nothing else, had
been ailing lately; she, Mrs. Layne, could not think what was the
matter with her, unless it was the unusually warm spring. She grew
thinner and weaker daily; her cheeks were pale, her eyes seemed to
have no life in them: she was very low in spirits; yet, in spite of all
this, Mary had kept on saying it was &ldquo;nothing.&rdquo; My Lady Chavasse&mdash;returning
home from London yesterday, whither she had accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
her son a week or two ago, and whom she had left there&mdash;was
so much struck with the change she saw in Mary, who lived with her
as humble companion, Mrs. Layne added, in a parenthesis, that she
insisted on her seeing Dr. Duffham, that he might prescribe some
tonics. And accordingly Mary had walked to her mother&rsquo;s this afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. Luke Duffham listened to all this with one ear, as it were. He
supposed it might be the warm spring, as suggested. However, he took
Mary into the patients&rsquo; room, and examined her; felt her pulse, looked
at her tongue, sounded her chest, with all the rest of it that doctors
treat their clients to; and asked her this, that, and the other&mdash;about
five-and-twenty questions, when perhaps five might have done. The
upshot of it all was that Mary Layne went off in a dead faint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth can be the matter with her?&rdquo; cried the alarmed
mother, when they had brought her round.</p>

<p>Mr. Luke Duffham, going back to the surgery with Mrs. Layne, shut
the doors, and told her what he thought it was. It so startled the old
lady that she backed against the counter and upset the scales.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you say so, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am sure of it,&rdquo; returned Mr. Luke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord be good to me!&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Layne, looking like one
terrified out of her seven senses. &ldquo;The worst I feared was that it
might be consumption. A sister of mine died of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where shall I send the medicine to?&rdquo; inquired the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anywhere. Over the way, if you like,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Layne, in
her perturbation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Where to, over the way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To my house. Don&rsquo;t you know me? I am the widow of your
brother&rsquo;s late partner. This unhappy child is the one he was fondest
of; she is only nineteen, much younger than the rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Layne!&rdquo; thought Luke Duffham, in surprise, &ldquo;I wish I had
known; I might have hesitated before speaking plainly. But where
would have been the good?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first thing Mrs. Layne did, was to shut her own door against
Mary, and send her back to the Grange in a shower of anger. She
was an honest old lady, of most irreproachable character; never
needing, as she phrased it, to have had a blush on her cheek, for herself
or any one belonging to her. In her indignation, she could have
crushed Mary to the earth. Whatever it might be that the poor girl
had done, robbed a church, or shot its parson, her mother deemed that
she deserved hanging.</p>

<p>Mary Layne walked back to the Grange: where else had she to go?
Broken-hearted, humiliated, weak almost unto death, she was as a
reed in her mother&rsquo;s hands, yielding herself to any command given;
and only wishing she might die. Lady Chavasse, compassionating her
evident suffering, brought her a glass of wine with her own hand, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
inquired what Mr. Duffham said, and whether he was going to give her
tonics. Instead of answering, Mary went into another faint: and my
lady thought she had overwalked herself. &ldquo;I wish I had sent her in
the carriage,&rdquo; said she kindly. And while the wish was yet upon her
lips, Mrs. Layne arrived at the Grange, to request an audience of her
ladyship.</p>

<p>Then was commotion. My lady talked and stormed, Mrs. Layne
talked and cried. Both were united in one thing&mdash;heaping reproaches
on Mary. They were in the grand drawing-room&mdash;where my lady
had been sitting when Mrs. Layne was shown in. Lady Chavasse sat
back, furious and scornful, in her pink velvet chair; Mrs. Layne
stood; Mary had sunk on the carpet kneeling, her face bent, her
clasped hands raised as if imploring mercy. This group was suddenly
broken in upon by Sir Geoffry&mdash;who had but then reached the Grange
from town. They were too noisy to notice him. Halting in dismay
he had the pleasure of catching a sentence or two addressed to the
unhappy Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best thing you can do is to find refuge in the workhouse,&rdquo;
stormed Lady Chavasse. &ldquo;Out of my house you turn this hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best thing you can do is to go on the tramp, where you won&rsquo;t
be known,&rdquo; amended Mrs. Layne, who was nearly beside herself with
conflicting emotions. &ldquo;Never again shall you enter the home that was
your poor dead father&rsquo;s. You wicked girl!&mdash;and you hardly twenty
years old yet! But, my lady, I can but think&mdash;though I know we are
humble people, as compared with you, and perhaps I&rsquo;ve no right to say
it&mdash;that Sir Geoffry has not behaved like a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, woman,&rdquo; said her ladyship. &ldquo;Sir Geoffry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Geoffry is at least enough of a gentleman to take his evil deeds
on himself, and not shift them on to others,&rdquo; spoke the baronet,
stepping forward&mdash;and the unexpected interruption was startling to
them all. My lady pointed imperatively to the door, but he stood his
ground.</p>

<p>It was no doubt a bitter moment for him; bringing home to him an
awful amount of self-humiliation: for throughout his life he had striven
to do right instead of wrong. And when these better men yield to
temptation instead of fleeing from it, the reacting sting is of the
sharpest. The wisest and strongest sometimes fall: and find too late
that, though the fall was so easy, the picking-up is of all things most
difficult. Sir Geoffry&rsquo;s face was white as death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get up, Mary,&rdquo; he said gently, taking her hand to help her in all
respect. &ldquo;Mrs. Layne,&rdquo; he added, turning to face the others; &ldquo;my
dear mother&mdash;if I may dare still to call you so&mdash;suffer me to say a
word. For all that has taken place, I am alone to blame; on me only
must it rest, The fault&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sin, sir,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Layne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Thank you. Sin. The sin lies with me, not with Mary.
In my presence reproach shall not be visited on her. She has enough
trouble to bear without that. I wish to Heaven that I had never&mdash;Mrs.
Layne, believe me,&rdquo; he resumed, after the pause, &ldquo;no one can
feel this more keenly than I. And, if circumstances permit me to
make reparation, I will make it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Geoffry wanted (circumstances permitting, as he shortly put it)
to marry Mary Layne; he <em>wished</em> to do it. Taking his mother into
another room he told her this. Lady Chavasse simply thought him
mad. She grew a little afraid of him, lest he should set her and all
high rules of propriety at nought, and do it.</p>

<p>But trouble like this cannot be settled in an hour. Lady Chavasse,
in her great fear, conciliated just a little: she did not turn Miss Layne
out at once, as threatened, but suffered her to remain at the Grange for
the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In any case, whatever may be the ending of this, it is not from my
family that risk of exposure must come,&rdquo; spoke Sir Geoffry, in a tone
of firmness. &ldquo;It might leave me no alternative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No alternative?&rdquo; repeated Lady Chavasse. &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Between my duty to you, and my duty to her,&rdquo; said Sir Geoffry.
And my lady&rsquo;s heart fainted within her at the suggested fear.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>They were together in the library at Chavasse Grange, Lady
Chavasse and her only son Geoffry. It was early morning; they had
sat in the breakfast-room making a show of partaking of the morning
meal, each of them with that bitter trouble at the heart that had been
known only&mdash;to my lady, at least&mdash;since the previous day. But the
farce of speaking in monosyllables to one another could not be kept up&mdash;the
trouble had to be dealt with, and without delay; and when the
poor meal could not be prolonged by any artifice, Sir Geoffry held
open the door for his mother to pass through, and crossed the hall
with her to the library. Shut within its walls they could discuss the
secret in safety; no eye to see them, no ear to hear.</p>

<p>Sir Geoffry mechanically stirred the fire, and placed a chair for his
mother near it. The weather appeared to be changing. Instead of
the unseasonable relaxing warmth that had been upon the earth up to
the previous day, a cold north-east wind had set in, enough to freeze
people&rsquo;s marrow. The skies were grey and lowering; the trees shook
and moaned: winter was taking up his place again.</p>

<p>So much the better. Blue skies and brightness would hardly have
accorded with Sir Geoffry&rsquo;s spirit. He might have to endure many
cruel visitations ere he died, but never a one so cruel as this. No evil
that Heaven can send upon us, or man inflict, is so hard to bear as self-reproach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>If ever a son had idolized a mother, it had surely been Geoffry
Chavasse. They had been knit together in the strongest bonds of filial
love. His whole thought from his boyhood had been her comfort: to
have sacrificed himself for her, if needs must, would have been a
cheerful task. When he came of age, not yet so very many months
ago, he had resolved that his whole future life should be devoted to
promote her happiness&mdash;as her life had been devoted to him in the
days of his sickly boyhood. Her wishes were his; her word his law;
he would have died rather than cause her a moment&rsquo;s pain.</p>

<p>And how had he, even thus early, fulfilled this? Look at him, as
he leans against the heavy framework of the window, drawn back from
it that the light may not fall on his subdued face. The brow is bent in
grievous doubt; the dark-blue eyes, generally so honestly clear, are hot
with trouble; the bright hair hangs limp. Yes; he would have died
rather than bring his mother pain: that was his true creed and belief;
but, like many another whose resolves are made in all good faith, he had
signally failed, even while he was thinking it, and brought pain to her
in a crushing heap. He hated himself as he looked at her pale
countenance; at the traces of tears in her heavy eyes. Never a
minute&rsquo;s sleep had she had the previous night, it was plainly to be
seen; and, as for him, he had paced his chamber until morning, not
attempting to go to rest. But there was a task close before him,
heavier than any that had gone before; heavier even than this silent
repentance&mdash;the deciding <em>what</em> was to be done in the calamity; and
Sir Geoffry knew that his duty to his mother and his duty to another
would clash with each other. All the past night he had been earnestly
trying to decide which of the two might be evaded with the least sin&mdash;and
he thought he saw which.</p>

<p>Lady Chavasse had taken the chair he placed for her; sitting upright
in it, and waiting for him to speak. She knew, as well as he, that this
next hour would decide their fate in life: whether they should still be
together a loving mother and son; or whether they should become
estranged and separate for ever. He crossed to the fireplace and put
his elbow on the mantelpiece, shielding his eyes with his hand. Just
a few words, he said, of his sense of shame and sorrow; of regret that
he should have brought this dishonour on himself and his mother&rsquo;s
home; of hope that he might be permitted, by Heaven and circumstances,
to work out his repentance, in endeavouring daily, hourly
constantly, to atone to her for it&mdash;to her, his greatly-loved mother.
And then&mdash;lifting his face from the hand that had partially hidden it&mdash;he
asked her to be patient, and to hear him without interruption a little
further. And Lady Chavasse bowed her head in acquiescence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing remains for me but to marry Miss Layne,&rdquo; he began: and
my lady, as she heard the expected avowal, bit her compressed lips
&ldquo;It is the only course open to me; unless I would forfeit every claim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to honour, and to the respect of upright men. If you will give your
consent to this, the evil may be in a degree repaired; nothing need
ever be known; Mary&rsquo;s good name may be saved&mdash;mine, too, if it
comes to that&mdash;and eventually we may be all happy together&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not try me too much, Geoffry,&rdquo; came the low interruption.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, you signified that you would hear me to the end. I will
not try you more than I can help; but it is necessary that I should
speak fully. All last night I was walking about my room in self-commune;
deliberating what way was open, if any, that it would be
practicable to take&mdash;and I saw but this one. Let me marry her. It
will be easy of accomplishment&mdash;speaking in reference to appearances
and the world. She might go for a week or two to her mother&rsquo;s; for a
month or two, if it were thought better and less suspicious; there is
no pressing hurry. We could then be married quietly, and go abroad
for a year or so, or for longer; and come back together to the Grange,
and be your dutiful and loving children always, just as it was intended
I and Rachel should be. But that you have liked Mary Layne very
much, I might have felt more difficulty in proposing this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have liked her as my servant,&rdquo; said Lady Chavasse, scornfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, you have liked her as a lady. Do you remember once
saying&mdash;it was when she first came&mdash;that if you had had a daughter
you could have wished her to be just like Mary Layne. Before I ever
saw her, you told me she was a sweet, elegant young woman; and&mdash;mother&mdash;she
is nothing less. Oh, mother, mother!&rdquo; continued Sir
Geoffry, with emotion, &ldquo;if you will but forget your prejudices for my
sake, and consent to what I ask, we would endeavour to be ever
repaying you in love and services during our after-life. I know what
a great sacrifice it will be; but for my sake I venture to crave it of
you&mdash;for my sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great fear lay upon Lady Chavasse: it had lain on her ever since
the previous day&mdash;that he might carry this marriage out of his own
will. So that she dared not answer too imperatively. She was bitterly
hurt, and caught her breath with a sob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want to kill me, Geoffry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven knows that I wish I had been killed, before I brought this
distress upon you,&rdquo; was his rejoinder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>am</em> distressed. I have never felt anything like it since your
father died. No; not once when you, a child of seven, were given over
in illness, and it was thought you would not live till morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Geoffry passed his hand hastily across his eyes, in which stood
the hot tears. His heart was sore, nearly unto breaking; his ingratitude
to his mother seemed fearfully great. He longed to throw himself at
her feet, and clasp her knees, and tell how deep for her was his love,
how true and deep it always would be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though the whole world had united to deceive me, Geoffry, I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
never have believed that you would do so. Why did you pretend to
be fond of Rachel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never pretended to be fonder of Rachel than I was. I liked her
as a cousin, nothing more. I know it now. And&mdash;mother&rdquo;&mdash;he
added, with a flush upon his face, and a lowering of the voice, &ldquo;it is
better and safer that the knowledge should have come to me before our
marriage than after it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Lady Chavasse. &ldquo;Once married, a man of right
principles is always safe in them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Geoffry was silent. Not very long ago, he had thought himself
safe in his. With every word, it seemed that his shame and his sin
came more glaringly home to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you mean to tell me that you do not like Rachel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I have no love for her. If&mdash;if there be any one plea that I
can put forth as a faint shadow of excuse for what has happened, it lies
in my love for another. Faint it is, Heaven knows: the excuse, not
the love. <em>That</em> is deep enough: but I would rather not speak of it to
you&mdash;my mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that you never will love Rachel?&rdquo; continued Lady Chavasse,
as though he had not interposed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never. It is impossible that I can ever love any one but Mary
Layne. I am grateful, as things have turned out, that I did not deceive
Rachel by feigning what I could not feel. Neither does she love me. We
were told to consider ourselves betrothed, and did so accordingly; but,
so far as love goes, it has not been so much as mentioned between us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else have you to say?&rdquo; asked Lady Chavasse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might say a great deal, but it would all come round to the same
point: to the one petition that I am beseeching you to grant&mdash;that you
will sanction the marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Chavasse&rsquo;s hands trembled visibly within their rich lace frills,
as they lay passive on her soft dress of fine geranium cashmere. Her
lips grew white with agitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Geoffry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My darling mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard you. Will you hear me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than one-and-twenty years ago, my husband died within these
walls; and I&mdash;I was not eighteen, Geoffry&mdash;felt utterly desolate. But,
as the weeks went on, I said my child will be born, if God permit, and
he will bring me comfort. You were born, Geoffry; you did bring me
comfort: such comfort that I thought Heaven had come again. You
best know, my son, what our life has been; how we have loved each
other: how pleasantly time has flown in uninterrupted happiness. I
have devoted myself, my time, my energies, everything I possessed, to
you, my best treasure; I have given up the world for you, Geoffry; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
had only you left in it. Is it fitting that you should fling me from you
now; that you should blight my remaining days with misery; that you
should ignore me just as though I were already dead&mdash;and all for the
sake of a stranger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not finished, Geoffry. For the sake of a stranger, whom a
few months ago neither you nor I had ever seen? If you think this&mdash;if
you deem that you would be acting rightly, and can find in your
heart to treat me so, why, you must do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what I wish and propose is quite different!&rdquo; he exclaimed in
agony. &ldquo;Oh, mother, surely you can understand me&mdash;and the dilemma
I am placed in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand all perfectly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Geoffry, there is no middle course. You must choose between me
and&mdash;<em>her</em>. Once she and I separate&mdash;it will be to-day&mdash;we can never
meet again. I will not tolerate her memory; I will never submit to
the degradation of hearing her named in my presence. Our paths lie
asunder, Geoffry, far as the poles: hers lies one way, mine another.
You must decide for yourself which of them you will follow. If it be
mine, you shall be, as ever, my dear and honoured son, and I will
never, never reproach you with your folly: never revert to it; never
think of it. If it be hers, why, then&mdash;I will go away somewhere and
hide myself, and leave the Grange free for you. And I&mdash;I dare say&mdash;shall
not live long to be a thorn in your remembrance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She broke down with a flood of bitter sobs. Geoffry Chavasse had
never seen his mother shed such. The hour was as trying to her as to
him. She had loved him with a strangely selfish love, as it is in the
nature of mothers to do; and that she should have to bid him choose
between her and another&mdash;and one so entirely beneath her as Lady
Chavasse considered Mary Layne to be&mdash;was gall and wormwood.
Never would she have stooped to put the choice before him, even in
words, but for her dread that he might be intending to take it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a fitting end, Geoffry&mdash;that this worthless girl should supplant
me in your home and heart,&rdquo; she was resuming when her emotion
allowed; but Geoffry stood forward to face her, his agitation great as
her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An instant, mother: that you may fully understand me. The
duty I owe you, the allegiance and the love, are paramount to all else
on earth. In communing with myself last night, as I tell you I was,
my heart and my reason alike showed me this. If I must choose between
you and Mary Layne, there cannot be a question in my mind on
which side duty lies. In all honour I am bound to make her my wife,
and I should do it in all affection: but not in defiance of you; not to
thrust rudely aside the love and obligations of the past one-and-twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
years. <em>You</em> must choose for me. If you refuse your approval, I
have no resource but to yield to your decision; if you consent, I shall
thank you and bless you for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A spasm of pain passed across the mouth of Lady Chavasse. She
could not help saying something that arose prominently in her mind
though it interrupted the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you can deem the apothecary Layne&rsquo;s daughter fit to mate
with Sir Geoffry Chavasse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not. Under ordinary circumstances, I should never have
thought of such a thing. This unhappy business has a sting for me,
mother, on many sides. Will you give me your decision?&rdquo; he added,
after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have already given it, Geoffry&mdash;so far as I am concerned. You
must choose between your mother, between all the hopes and the
home-interests of one-and-twenty years, and this alien.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I have no alternative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned her gaze steadily upon him. A sob rose in his throat as
he took her hands, his voice was hoarse with emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To part from her will be like parting with life, mother. I can
never know happiness again in this world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the decision was irrevocable. What further passed between Sir
Geoffry and his mother in the remaining half-hour they spent together,
how much of entreaty and anguish was spoken on his side, how much
of passionate plaint and sorrow on hers, will never be known. But she
was obdurate to the last letter: and Sir Geoffry&rsquo;s lot in life was fixed.
Mary Layne was to be sacrificed: and, in one sense of the word, himself
also: and there might be no appeal.</p>

<p>Lady Chavasse exacted from him that he should quit the Grange at
once without seeing Miss Layne, and not return to it until Mary had
left it for ever. Anything he wished to say to her, he was to write.
On Lady Chavasse&rsquo;s part, she voluntarily undertook to explain to Miss
Layne their conversation faithfully, and its result; and to shield the
young lady&rsquo;s good name from the censure of the world. She would
keep her for some time longer at the Grange, be tender with her,
honour her, drive out with her in the carriage so that they might be
seen together, subdue her mother&rsquo;s anger, strive to persuade Mr. Luke
Duffham that his opinion had been mistaken, and, in any case, bind
him down to secrecy: in short, she would make future matters as easy
as might be for Mary, as tenaciously as though she were her own
daughter. That she promised this at the sacrifice of pride and of much
feeling, was indisputable; but she meant to keep her word.</p>

<p>However miserable a night the others had passed, it will readily be
imagined that Mary Layne had spent a worse. She made no pretence
of eating breakfast; and when it was taken away sat at her work in
the garden-parlour, trying to do it; but her cold fingers dropped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
needle every minute, her aching brow felt as though it were bursting.
Good-hearted Hester Picker was sorry to see her looking so ill, and
wished the nasty trying spring, hot one day, cold the next, would just
settle itself down.</p>

<p>Mary rose from her chair, and went upstairs to her own bedroom for
a brief respite: in her state of mind it seemed impossible to stay long
quiescent anywhere. This little incidental occurrence frustrated one
part of the understanding between Sir Geoffry and his mother&mdash;that he
should quit the house without seeing Miss Layne. In descending, she
chanced to cross the end of the corridor just as he came out of his
mother&rsquo;s room after bidding her farewell. The carriage waited at the
door, his coat was on his arm. Mary would have shrunk back again,
but he bade her wait.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must allow me to shake her hand, and say just a word of
adieu, mother; I am not quite a brute,&rdquo; he whispered. And Lady
Chavasse came out of her room, and tacitly sanctioned it.</p>

<p>But there was literally nothing more than a hand-shake. Miss
Layne, standing still in all humility, turned a little white, for she
guessed that he was being sent from his home through her. Sir
Geoffry held her hand for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going away, Mary. My mother will explain to you. I have
done my best, and failed. Before Heaven, I have striven to the uttermost,
for your sake and for mine, to make reparation; but it is not to
be. I leave you to my mother; she is your friend; and you shall hear
from me in a day or two. I am now going to see Mrs. Layne. Good-bye:
God bless you always!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, ere Sir Geoffry reached the hall, Lady Chavasse had run
swiftly down, caught him, and was drawing him into a room. The
fear had returned to her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard you say you were going to call on Mrs. Layne. Geoffry,
this must not be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Not be!</em>&rdquo; he repeated, in surprise. &ldquo;Mother, I am obeying you in
all essential things; but you cannot wish to reduce me to an utter
craven. I owe an explanation to Mrs. Layne almost in the same
degree that I owe it to you; and I shall certainly not quit Church
Dykely until I have given it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;if it must be,&rdquo; she conceded, afraid still. &ldquo;You&mdash;you
will not be drawn in to act against me, Geoffry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No power on earth could draw me to that. You have my first
and best allegiance; to which I bow before every other consideration,
before every interest, whether of my own or of others. But for that,
should I be acting as I am now? Fare you well, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She heard the carriage-door closed; she heard Sir Geoffry&rsquo;s order to
the footman. Even for that order, he was cautious to give a plausible
excuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop at Mrs. Layne&rsquo;s. I have to leave a message from her
ladyship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wheels of the carriage crunched the gravel, bearing off Sir
Geoffry in the storm of sleet&mdash;which had begun to fall&mdash;and Lady
Chavasse passed up the stairs again. Taking the hand of Mary&mdash;who
had stood above like a statue&mdash;never moving&mdash;she led her, gently
enough, into her dressing-room, and put her in a comfortable chair by
the fire; and prepared for this second interview.</p>

<p>Briefly, Lady Chavasse recounted what she had to say. Sir Geoffry
had found himself obliged to choose between Miss Layne and her, his
mother. Mary Layne sat with her hands before her face, and acknowledged
that, if it came to such a choice, he had chosen rightly. And
then, in forcible language, because it came from her heart, my lady
drew a picture of the life-long happiness she and her son had enjoyed
together, of her devotion and sacrifices for him, of his deep love and
reverence for her: and she quietly asked Mary to put herself in
imagination in her place, and say what her feelings would have been
had a stranger come in to mar this. Had she any right to do this?&mdash;Lady
Chavasse asked her&mdash;would she be justified in destroying the ties
of a life, in thrusting herself between mother and son?&mdash;in invoking a
curse, his mother&rsquo;s curse, on him? My lady did not spare her: but
she spoke in no angry tone, rather in a piteous and imploring one: and
Mary, feeling as if matters were being put to her own better feeling,
sobbed, and shook, and shrunk within herself, and could have knelt at
Lady Chavasse&rsquo;s feet for pardon in her distress and humiliation.</p>

<p>And that was the end of the wretched business&mdash;as Duffham phrases
it in his diary&mdash;so far as the Grange and its people were concerned.
Mary Layne stayed, perforce, two or three weeks longer at the house,
and my lady made much of her: she took her out daily in her carriage;
she said to her friends, in the hearing of her servants and the sympathizing
Hester Picker, how vexatious it was that the relaxing,
unseasonable weather had brought out the delicacy that was latent in
Miss Layne&rsquo;s constitution, and that she feared she must let her go
away somewhere for a change. Mary submitted to all. She was in
such a self-abased frame of mind that had my lady desired her to
immolate herself on a blazing pyre, she would have gone to it meekly.
My lady had interviews with Mrs. Layne, and with Duffham (who had
got well then), and with his brother Luke. At the two or three weeks&rsquo;
end, Miss Elizabeth Layne came by appointment to the Grange, and
she and Mary were driven to the nearest station in my lady&rsquo;s own
carriage on their way to the seaside: or to elsewhere, as it might be.
And never an ill breath, in the Grange or out of it, transpired to
tarnish the fair fame of Mary Layne.</p>

<p>But my lady was not honest in one respect. The letter that arrived
for Mary from Sir Geoffry a day or two after his departure, was never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
given to her. My lady knew she might trust her son implicitly; he
could only be straightforward and keep his word in all things; nevertheless,
she deemed the fire the safest place for the weighty epistle of
many sheets. On the other hand, Mary wrote to Sir Geoffry, saying
that the alternative he had chosen was the only one possible to him.
Nothing, no prayers of his, she said, would have induced her to put
herself between him and his mother, even had he so far forgotten his
duty as to urge it. It was a good and sensible letter, and none but a
good and unselfish girl could have written it.</p>

<p>So that ended the dream and the romance. And I hope the reader
does not forget that it is Duffham&rsquo;s diary that&rsquo;s telling all this, and not
I. For though dreams and romance seem to be in Duffham&rsquo;s line,
they are not in mine.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<h3>Part the Second.</h3>

<p>Not very long after the time that Mary Layne quitted Chavasse
Grange&mdash;having closed all connection with it, never to be to it henceforth
but as an utter stranger&mdash;her eldest sister, Susan, the wife of
Captain Richard Layne, arrived in England from India with her children,
four little ones; the eldest seven years old, the youngest eighteen
months. The children had been ailing, and she brought them over for
a twelvemonth&rsquo;s change. Mrs. Layne was a good deal worn herself,
for the only nurse she had with her, a coloured woman, was sea-sick
during the voyage. Her sister Eleanor, who originally went out with
her to Calcutta, had made an excellent match; having married Allan
McAlpin, the younger partner in the staid old firm of McAlpin Brothers,
merchants of high standing, and wealthy men.</p>

<p>The first thing Mrs. Richard Layne did on arrival was to establish
herself in lodgings in Liverpool, the port she landed at (in order to rest
a week or two from the fatigues of the voyage) and send for her
mother and sister Elizabeth. In answer came a letter from her mother,
saying she was not equal to the journey and that Elizabeth was from
home. It contained Elizabeth&rsquo;s present address, and also one or two
items of news that startled young Mrs. Layne well-nigh out of her
senses. Leaving her children to their nurse&rsquo;s care, she started for the
address given, and found her two sisters, Elizabeth and Mary. The
one living in a chronic state of outpouring sarcasm and reproach; the
other meekly taking all as not a tithe of her just due.</p>

<p>After a day or two given to natural grief and lamentation, Mrs.
Richard Layne took matters into her own capable hands. She considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
that a more complete change would be good for Mary, and
decided to convey her to the Continent. She wrote a long and confidential
letter to her husband in India, of what she meant to do: and
then she went back to Liverpool with Elizabeth, to leave the latter in
charge of her own children and their coloured nurse, during her
absence across the Channel. Mrs. Layne then returned to Mary, and
they started together for France.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, old Mrs. Layne fell ill: and Elizabeth, when she
found she must go home in consequence, left a responsible English
nurse with the coloured woman and children. Not for several months
afterwards did Mrs. Richard Layne and Mary return from abroad; and
at the end of the twelvemonth they all went back to India&mdash;Mrs.
Layne, her children, the native nurse, and Mary. Mary accompanied
them in the capacity of governess.</p>

<p>After that a couple of years went on.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<h4>[<i>From Miss Mary Layne&rsquo;s Journal, written in Calcutta, at the house
of Captain Layne.</i>]</h4>

<p><i>June 10th.</i>&mdash;Cool of the evening. Susan came to the schoolroom in
the midst of the geography lesson this morning, and told me an old
friend of mine at home had called, and I was to come into the verandah
to see her. I never was more surprised. It was Jane Arkill; my chief
friend in our old school-days. She has married a Mr. Cale, a doctor,
who has just come out here to practise. Mrs. Cale says she shall never
grow reconciled to the heat of India. While she sat telling us home
news, she alternately wiped her pale face and stared at me, because
I am so much altered. She thinks she should not have known me.
It is not that my features have changed, she says, but that I have
grown so much graver, and look so old. When people talk like this,
I long to tell them that things have changed me; that I have passed
through a fiery trial of sin and suffering; that my life is one long
crucifixion of inward, silent repentance. When I first came out, two
years ago, and people would say, &ldquo;It must be the climate that is
making Miss Layne look so ill,&rdquo; it seemed to me like the worst hypocrisy
to let them think it was the climate, and not to tell the truth. This
feeling came back again to-day, when Jane Arkill&mdash;I shall often forget
to call her &ldquo;Cale&rdquo;&mdash;said my eyes had grown to have a sad look in
them; and Susan answered that young ladies faded quickly in India;
and that Mary <em>would</em> apply herself too closely to the children&rsquo;s studies
in spite of remonstrance. Too closely? Why, if I devoted every hour
of my life, night and day, to these dear children, I could never repay
what their mother&mdash;or their father, either&mdash;has done for me.</p>

<p>My mother is very well, Jane says, but lame, and cannot get about
much: she saw her only six weeks ago&mdash;for they came out by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
overland route. Only six weeks ago!&mdash;to hear that one has seen my
dear mother so recently as that, makes it seem almost as though <em>I</em> had
seen her but yesterday. My darling mother!&mdash;whom my conduct so
grieved and outraged at the time, and who was so quick to forgive me
and to do so much for me. What a message she has sent me! &ldquo;Give
my love to dear Mary, and say I hope she is happy with her sisters.&rdquo;
Elizabeth, too, sent me her love. &ldquo;I saw your little Arthur, Mrs.
Layne,&rdquo; Jane Cale then said to my sister: &ldquo;he is a sweet little fellow;
your mother and Elizabeth are so fond of him. They call him Baby
Arthur.&rdquo; I felt my face growing whiter than death: but Susan, who
was never I believe put out in her life, quietly sent me away with a
message to the nurse&mdash;that she might bring the children. When I
got back, Captain Layne had come in and had the baby on his
shoulder: for nurse had made more haste than I. &ldquo;None of your
children here are so fair as the little one your wife left in England,
Captain Layne,&rdquo; Jane Cale was saying, as she looked at them one by
one. &ldquo;You mean little Arthur,&rdquo; returned the Captain, in his ready
kindness; &ldquo;I hear he is fair.&rdquo; &ldquo;Have you never seen him?&rdquo; &ldquo;No;
how should I have seen him?&rdquo; asked Captain Layne, laughing:
&ldquo;he was born over there, and my wife left him behind her as a
legacy to her mother. It is rather a hazard, Mrs. Cale, as perhaps you
know, to bring out very young infants to this country.&rdquo; Susan came
to the rescue: she took the baby and put him on his feet, that Mrs.
Cale should see how well he walked for his twelvemonth&rsquo;s age. But it
did not answer. No doubt Jane thought that the more she told them
about Baby Arthur in England, the better pleased they would be. How
much difference was there, she asked, between this child and little
Arthur&mdash;eighteen months?&mdash;and how much between Arthur and the
one above him? &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;if it comes to months, you
must ask my wife. Come here, sir,&rdquo; he called to Robert, who was
tumbling over the little black bearer, &ldquo;tell this lady how old <em>you</em> are,
for I am sure I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m over four,&rdquo; lisped Bobby. &ldquo;Ah, I see,&rdquo;
said Jane Cale, &ldquo;Baby Arthur is just between them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo;
said Captain Layne: &ldquo;Susan, I think these children may go to their
own quarters now.&rdquo; They went at once, for I have trained them to be
obedient, and I escaped with them. It is the first time any human
tongue has spoken to me of Baby Arthur. I think if Captain Layne
had looked at me I should have died: but he is ever kind. Never, by
so much as a word, or look, or tone, since the hour when I first set foot
on these shores, his wife&rsquo;s humbled sister, his children&rsquo;s meek governess&mdash;and
it is more than good of him to entrust their training to <em>me</em>!&mdash;never
has he betrayed that he as much as knew anything, still less
thought of it.</p>

<p>Oh, how events have been smoothed for me!&mdash;how much more than
I deserve have I to be thankful for!</p>

<h4>[<i>Letter from Captain Layne&rsquo;s Wife to her Mother at Church Dykely.</i>]</h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="dat">Calcutta, September 2nd.<br /></p>

<p class="smcap">My Darling Mother,</p>

<p class="ind">I am sitting down to answer your letter, which arrived by last
mail: for I am sure you must wonder at my long silence and think it
an age since I wrote. But the truth is, I have had a touch of my old
complaint&mdash;intermittent fever&mdash;and it left me very weak and languid.
I know you have an untiring correspondent in Eleanor. Perhaps that
makes me a little negligent in writing home, though I am aware it
ought not to do so.</p>

<p>We were truly glad to welcome Mrs. Cale, because she had so
recently come from you. I cannot say that I have seen much of her
as yet, for it was just after she got out that my illness began; and when
I grew better my husband sent me to the hills for a change. Mary
went with me and the children. She is the greatest comfort. Mother
dear, in spite of what we know of, I do not think Mary has her equal
for true worth in this world. You say that Mrs. Cale, in writing home
to you, described Mary as being so altered; so sad and subdued. Why,
my dear mother, of course she is sad: how could it be otherwise? I
do not suppose, in her more recent life, she has ever felt other than the
most intense sadness of mind; no, not for one minute: and it is only to
be expected that this must in time show itself in the countenance. I
spoke to her about it one day; it is a long, long time ago now; saying
I did not like to see her retain so much sadness. &ldquo;It cannot be helped,&rdquo;
she answered; &ldquo;sadness must always follow sin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now I must tell you, even at the risk of being misunderstood&mdash;though
I am sure you know me too well to fear I should seek to
countenance or excuse wrong-doing&mdash;that I think Mary takes an exaggerated
view of the past. She seems to think it can never be wiped
out, never be palliated. Of course, in one sense, it never can: but I
<em>don&rsquo;t</em> see why she need continue to feel this intense humiliation, as if she
ought to have a cordon drawn round her gown to warn all good folks
from its contact. Look again at that persistent fancy of hers, always to
wear black; it is writing about her gown puts me in mind of it. Black,
black, black: thin silk when the heat will allow, oftener a dreary,
rusty-black-looking kind of soft muslin that is called here &ldquo;black
jaconite&rdquo;&mdash;but I really don&rsquo;t know whether that&rsquo;s the way to spell the
thing. During the late intense heat, we have talked her into a black-and-white
muslin: that is, white, with huge black spots upon it in the
form of a melon. Only once did I speak to her about wearing white
as we do; I have never ventured since. She turned away with a shiver,
and said white was no longer for her. Mother, dear, if any one ever
lived to work out on earth their repentance for sin, surely it is Mary.
The more I see of her innate goodness, the less can I understand the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
past. With her upright principles and strict sense of conscientiousness&mdash;and
you know that Mary always had these, even as a child&mdash;I am
unable to imagine how it could have been that&mdash;&mdash; But I won&rsquo;t go
into that. And it may be that the goodness, so remarkable, would not
have come out conspicuously but for the trial.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cale gave us such a nice account of &ldquo;Baby Arthur.&rdquo; She says
he is very fair and pretty. She has talked to other people about him&mdash;and
of course we cannot tell her not to talk. A brother-officer of my
husband&rsquo;s said to me yesterday:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear your little boy at home is charming, Mrs. Layne. When
shall you have him out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;He was a very delicate baby, and I should
not like to risk it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Major Grant, &ldquo;that is why you left him in England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother takes great care of him,&rdquo; I went on; &ldquo;it would break
her heart if I were to bring him away from her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You will wonder at my writing all this: but it is so new a thing to
hear &ldquo;Baby Arthur&rdquo; made a topic of discussion, and all through Mrs.
Cale! Talking of children, Eleanor is, I think, getting somewhat over
her long-continued disappointment. Four years she has been married,
and has none. It is certainly a pity, when she and Allan McAlpin are
so well off. Not a family in Calcutta lives in better style than they&mdash;people
here talk of the house of McAlpin Brothers as we at home
talk of Rothschild&rsquo;s and Baring&rsquo;s. I am sure they must be very rich,
and poor Eleanor naturally thinks where is the use of the riches when
there&rsquo;s no child to leave them to. Eleanor said to me the other day
when she was here, &ldquo;You might as well make over that child of yours
to me, Susan,&rdquo;&mdash;meaning Baby Arthur; &ldquo;he does you no good, and
must be a trouble to mamma and Elizabeth.&rdquo; Of course I laughed it
off; saying that you and Elizabeth would not part with him for untold
gold. And I believe it is so, is it not, dear mother? Do you remember
when I first went to your house with the poor little infant, after his
birth on the Continent, you took him out of my arms with an averted
face, as if you would rather have thrown him on the floor, and Elizabeth
turned away and groaned? &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you may grow to love
the child in time, and then you will be more ready to forgive and
forget.&rdquo; And that has come to pass.</p>

<p>Mary has always been against our not telling the truth to Eleanor;
she says, even yet, that she feels like a hypocrite before her; but I
feel sure it was best and wisest. Eleanor is as sensitive in her way as
Mary is; Eleanor holds a high position in the place; she and her
husband are both courted, she for herself, he for his riches, for his high
commercial name, for his integrity; and I know she would have <em>felt</em>
the slur almost as keenly as Mary. It is true I do not like deliberate
deceit; but there was really no need to tell her&mdash;it would not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
answered any good end. Until Mrs. Cale talked, Eleanor scarcely
remembered that there was a Baby Arthur; and now she seems quite
jealous that he is mine and she cannot have him. I say to Eleanor
that she must be contented with the good she has; her indulgent
husband, her position. We poor officers&rsquo; wives cannot compete with
her in grandeur. By the way, talking of officers, you will be glad to
hear that my husband expects his majority. It will be a welcome rise.
For, with our little ones and our expenses, it is rather difficult at times
to make both ends meet. We shall come into money some time from
the West Indies; but until then every pound of additional pay is
welcome.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cale told us another item of news; that is, she recounted it
amidst the rest, little thinking what it was to us. That Sir G.&nbsp;C. is
married, and living with his wife at the Grange with Lady C. You
have been keeping the fact back, dear mother; either through not
choosing to mention their names, or out of consideration to Mary.
But I can assure you she was <em>thankful</em> to hear of it; it has removed a
little of the abiding sting from her life. You cannot imagine how
unselfish she is: she looks upon herself as the sole cause of all that
occurred. I mean that she says it was through her going to the
Grange. Had she not gone, the peace of mother and son would never
have been disturbed. <em>I</em> think Lady C. was <em>selfish</em> and <em>wrong</em>; that she
ought to have allowed Sir G. to do as he wished. Mary says no; that
Lady C.&rsquo;s comfort and her lifelong feelings were above every other
consideration. She admires Lady C. more than I do. However, she
is truly glad to hear that the marriage took place. Events have fallen
now into their original course, and she trusts that the bitter episode in
which she took part may be gradually forgotten at the Grange. The
day we first heard of his marriage, I went hastily&mdash;and I fear you will
say rudely&mdash;into Mary&rsquo;s room at night when she was preparing for
rest, having omitted to tell her something I wished changed in Nelly&rsquo;s
studies for the morning. She was on her knees, and rose up; the
tears were literally streaming down her sweet face, &ldquo;Oh, Mary, what
is the matter?&rdquo; I asked, in dismay. &ldquo;I was only praying for God to
bless them,&rdquo; she answered simply. Is she not a good, unselfish girl?</p>

<p>I could fill pages with her praises. What she has been to my
children, during these two years she has had them in charge, I can
never tell. She insisted upon being regarded and treated wholly as a
governess; but, as my husband says, no real governess could be half
so painstaking, untiring, and conscientious. She has earned the respect
of all Calcutta, and she shrinks from it as if it were something to be
shunned, saying, &ldquo;If people did but know!&rdquo; Nelly, from being the
only girl, and perhaps also because she was the eldest and her papa
loved her so, was the most tiresome, spoiled little animal in the world;
and the boys were boisterous, and I am afraid frightfully impudent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the native servants: but since Mary took them in hand they are
altogether different, fit to be loved. Richard often says he wishes he
could recompense her.</p>

<p>And now I must bring my letter to a close, or you will be tired.
The children all send love to grandmamma and Aunt Elizabeth: and
(it is Miss Nelly calls out this) to little brother Arthur. Nelly is
growing prettier every day: she is now going on for eleven. Young
Richard promises to be as tall and fine a man as his father. I believe
he is to be sent home next year to the school attached to King&rsquo;s
College in London. Little Allan is more delicate than I like to see
him; Bobby, a frightful Turk; baby, a dear little fellow. Master
Allan&rsquo;s godfather, Eleanor&rsquo;s husband, gave him a handsome present on
his last birthday&mdash;a railway train that would &ldquo;go.&rdquo; He had sent for
it from England: I am sure it never cost less than five pounds; and
the naughty child broke it before the day was out. I felt so vexed;
and downright ashamed to confess it to Eleanor. The Ayah said he
broke it for the purpose, &ldquo;to see what it was made of;&rdquo; and, in spite
of entreaties to the contrary, Richard was on the point of whipping
him for the mischief, and Allan was roaring in anticipation, when Mary
interposed, and begged to be let deal with him for it. What she said,
or what she did, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure there was no whipping; but
Master Allan was in a penitential and subdued mood for days after it,
voluntarily renouncing some pudding that he is uncommonly fond of,
because he had &ldquo;not been good.&rdquo; Richard says that he would rather
trust his children to Mary, to be made what they ought to be, than to
any one under heaven. Oh, it is grievous&mdash;that her life should have
been blighted!</p>

<p>My best love to you and Elizabeth, dearest mother, in which Richard
begs to join; and believe me, your affectionate daughter,</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign1">Susan Layne.</span><br /></p>

<p class="r2">P.S.&mdash;I have never before written openly on these private matters:
we have been content tacitly to ignore them to each other, but somehow
my pen has run on incautiously. Please, therefore, to burn this letter
when you and Elizabeth shall have read it.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h4>[<i>From Miss Mary Layne&rsquo;s Journal, about two years yet later.</i>]</h4>

<p><i>October 9th.</i>&mdash;I quite tremble at the untoward turn things seem to be
taking. To think that a noble gentleman should be casting his thoughts
on <em>me</em>! And he <em>is</em> a gentleman, and a noble one also, in spite of that
vain young adjutant, St. George&rsquo;s, slighting remark when Mr. McAlpin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
came in last night&mdash;&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s that confounded old warehouseman!&rdquo; It
was well the major did not hear him. He has to take St. George to
task on occasion, and he would have done it then with a will.</p>

<p>Andrew McAlpin is not an ordinary man. Head of a wealthy house,
whose integrity has never been questioned; himself of unsullied honour,
of handsome presence, of middle age, for surely, in his three-and-fortieth
year, he may be called it&mdash;owner of all these solid advantages, he has
actually turned his attentions upon me. Me! Oh, if he did but know!&mdash;if
he could but see the humiliation it brings to this already too
humiliated heart.</p>

<p>Has a glamour been cast over his sight&mdash;as they say in his own
land? Can he not see how I shrink from people when they notice me
by chance more than is usual? Does he not see how constantly I have
tried to shrink from <em>him</em>? If I thought that this had been brought
about by any want of precaution on my part, I should be doubly
miserable. When I was assistant-teacher at school in England, the
French governess, poor old Madame de Visme, confided to me something
that she was in the habit of doing; it was nothing wrong in itself,
but totally opposed to the arbitrary rules laid down, and, if discovered,
might have caused her to be abruptly dismissed. &ldquo;But suppose it
were found out, madame?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Ah non, mon enfant,&rdquo; she
answered; &ldquo;je prends mes précautions.&rdquo; Since then I have often
thought of the words: and I say to myself, now as I write, have I taken
precautions&mdash;proper ones? I can hardly tell. For one thing, I was
at first, and for some time, so totally unprepared; it would no more
have entered my mind to suppose Mr. McAlpin would think of paying
attention to me, than that the empty-headed Lieutenant St. George&mdash;who
boasts that his family is better than anybody&rsquo;s in India, and intends
to wed accordingly if he weds at all&mdash;would pay it.</p>

<p>When it first began&mdash;and that is so long ago that I can scarcely
remember, nearly a year, though&mdash;Mr. McAlpin would talk to me about
the children. I felt proud to answer him, dear little things; and I knew
he liked them, and Allan is his brother&rsquo;s godchild, and Robert is
Eleanor&rsquo;s. I am afraid that is where I was wrong: when he came
talking, evening after evening, I should have been on my guard, and
begged Susan to excuse me from appearing as often as she would. The
great evil lies in my having consented to appear at all in company.
For two years after I came out&mdash;oh, more than that; it must have been
nearly three&mdash;I resolutely refused to join them when they were not
alone. It was Major Layne&rsquo;s fault that the rule was broken through.
One day, when invitations were out for an evening party, Susan came
to me and said that the major particularly requested I would appear at
it. &ldquo;The fact is, Mary,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;there has been some talk at
the mess: you are very much admired&mdash;your face, I mean&mdash;and some
of them began wondering whether there was any <em>reason</em> for your never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
appearing in society; and whether you could really be my sister.
Richard was not present&mdash;that goes without saying&mdash;the colonel
repeated it to him afterwards in a joking way. But what the major
says is this, Mary&mdash;that he knows India and gossiping tongues better
than you do, and he desires for all our sakes, for yours of course
especially, that you will now and then show yourself with us. You are
to begin next Tuesday evening. Richard <em>begs</em> you will. And I have
been getting you a black net dress, with a little white lace for the body&mdash;you
cannot say that&rsquo;s too fine.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;for all our sakes&rdquo;
decided it; and I said I would certainly obey Major Layne. What else
could I do?</p>

<p>That was the beginning of it. Though I go out scarcely ever with
the major and Susan, declining invitations on the plea of my duties as
governess, it has certainly grown into a habit with me to spend my
evenings with them when they are at home.</p>

<p>But I never supposed anything like this would come of it. It has
always seemed to me as if the world could see me a little as I see
myself, and not think of me as one eligible to be chosen. As soon as I
suspected that Mr. McAlpin came here for me, I strove to show him
as plainly as I might that he was making a mistake. And now this
proves, as it seems to me, how wrong it was not to tell my sad story to
Eleanor, but to let her think of me as one still worthy. Susan knows
how averse I was to its suppression; but she overruled me, and said
Richard thought with her. Eleanor would have whispered it to her
husband, and he might have whispered to his brother Andrew, and this
new perplexity have been spared. It is not for my own sake I am so
sorry, but for his: crosses and vexations are only my due, and I try to
take them patiently; but I grow hot with shame every time I think
how he is deceived. Oh, if he would only speak out, and end it! that
I might thank him and tell him it is impossible: I should like to say
unfit. Susan might give him a hint; but when I urge her to do so, she
laughs at me and asks, How can she, until he has spoken?</p>

<p><i>October 25th.</i>&mdash;It has come at last. Mr. McAlpin, one of the best
men amidst the honourable men of the world, has asked me to become
his wife. Whilst I was trying to answer him, I burst into tears. We
were quite alone. &ldquo;Why do you weep?&rdquo; he asked, and I answered
that I thought it was because of my gratitude to him for his kindness,
and because I was so unworthy of it. It was perhaps a hazardous
thing to say&mdash;but I was altogether confused. I must have explained
myself badly, for he could not or would not understand my refusal; he
said he certainly should decline to take it: I must consider it well&mdash;for
a week&mdash;or a month&mdash;as long as I liked, provided I said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; at last.
When the crying was over, I felt myself again; and I told him, just
as quietly and calmly as I could speak, that I should never marry;
never. He asked <em>why</em>, and as I was hesitating what reason to give,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and praying to be helped to speak right in the emergency, we were
interrupted.</p>

<p>Oh, if I could only tell him the naked truth, as I here write it! That
the only one living man it would be possible for me to marry is
separated from me wider than seas can part. The barrier was thrown
up between us years ago, never to be overstepped by either of us:
whilst at the same time it shut me out from my kind. For this reason
I can never marry, and never shall marry, so long as the world, for me,
endures.</p>

<p><i>November 19th.</i>&mdash;This is becoming painful. Mr. McAlpin will not
give me up. He is all consideration and respect, he is not obtrusive,
but yet&mdash;he will not give me up. There can exist no good reason why
I should not have him, he says; and he is willing to wait for months
and years. Eleanor comes in with her remonstrances: &ldquo;Whatever
possesses you, Mary? You must be out of your mind, child, to refuse
Andrew McAlpin. For goodness&rsquo; sake, get a little common sense into
your poor crotchety head.&rdquo; Allan McAlpin, in his half-earnest, half-joking
way, says to me, &ldquo;Miss Layne, <em>I</em> make a perfect husband; ask
Eleanor if I don&rsquo;t; and I know Andrew will make a better.&rdquo; It is so
difficult for me to parry these attacks. The children even have taken
it up: and Richard to-day in the schoolroom called me Mrs. McAlpin.
Susan has tried to shield me throughout. The major says not a word
one way or the other.</p>

<p>A curious idea has come across me once or twice lately&mdash;that it
might be almost better to give Mr. McAlpin a hint of the truth. Of
course it is <em>but</em> an idea; one that can never be carried out; but I know
that he would be true as steel. I cannot bear for him to think me ungrateful:
and he must consider me both ungrateful and capricious. I
respect him and like him very much, and he sees this: if I were at
liberty as others are, I would gladly marry him: the great puzzle is,
how to make him understand that it is not possible. I suppose the
consciousness of my secret, which never leaves me, renders it more
difficult for me to be decisive than it would be if I possessed none. Not
the least painful part of it all is, that he brings me handsome presents,
and will not take them back again. He is nearly old enough to be my
father, he says, and so I must consider them as given to me in that
light. How shall I stop it?&mdash;how convince him?</p>

<p><i>November 29th.</i>&mdash;Well, I have done it. Last night there was a grand
dinner at the mess; some strangers were to join it on invitation; Susan
went to spend a quiet hour with the colonel&rsquo;s wife, and Mr. McAlpin
came in, and found me alone. What possessed me I cannot tell: but
I began to tremble all over. He asked what was the matter, and I
took courage to say that I always now felt distressed to see him come in,
knowing he came for my sake, and that I could not respond to him as
he wished. We had never had so serious a conversation as the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
that ensued. He begged me to at least tell him what the barrier was,
and where it lay: I thought he almost hinted that it was due to him.
&ldquo;There is some particular barrier, I feel sure,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;although
Eleanor tells me there is none.&rdquo; And then I took some more courage,
inwardly hoping to be helped to speak for the best, and answered Yes,
there <em>was</em> a barrier; one that could never be surmounted; and that I
had tried to make him see this all along. I told him how truly I
esteemed him; how little I felt in my own eyes at being so undeserving
of the opinion of a good man; I said I should thank him for it in my
heart for ever. Did the barrier lie in my loving another? he asked, and
I hesitated there. I <em>had</em> loved another, I said: it was before I came
out, and the circumstances attending it were very painful; indeed, it
was a painful story altogether. It had blighted my life; it had isolated
me from the world; it entirely prevented me from ever thinking of
another. I do believe he gathered from my agitation something of the
truth, for he was so kind and gentle. Eleanor knew nothing of it, I
said; Major and Mrs. Layne had thought there was no need to tell her,
and, of course, he would understand that I was speaking to him in
confidence. Yes, he answered, in confidence that I should not find
misplaced. I felt happier and more at ease with him than I had ever
done, for now I knew that misapprehension was over; and we talked
together on other matters peacefully, until Major Layne entered and
brought a shock with him.</p>

<p>A shock for me. One of the guests at the mess came with him: a
naval officer in his uniform: a big man of fifty or sixty years, with a
stern countenance and a cloud of untidy white hair. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Susan?&rdquo;
cried the major: &ldquo;out? Come here, then, Mary: you must be hostess.&rdquo;
And before I knew what or who it was, I had been introduced to
Admiral Chavasse. My head was in a whirl, my eyes were swimming:
I had not heard the name spoken openly for years. Major Layne little
thought he was related to G.&nbsp;C.: Mr. McAlpin had no idea that this
fine naval officer, Parker Chavasse, could be cousin to one of whom
I had been speaking covertly, but had not named. The admiral is
on cruise, has touched at Calcutta, and his vessel is lying in Diamond
Harbour.</p>

<p><i>November 30th.</i>&mdash;Oh dear! oh dear! That I should be the recipient
of so much goodness, and not be able to appreciate it!</p>

<p>A message came to the schoolroom this morning; Miss Layne was
wanted downstairs. It was Susan who sent, but I found Mr. McAlpin
alone. He had been holding a confidential interview with Susan: and
Susan, hearing how much I had said to him last night, confided to him
all. Oh, and he was willing to take me still; to take me as I am! I
fell down at his feet sobbing when I told him that it could not be.</p>

<h4>[<i>Private Note from Major Layne&rsquo;s Wife to her Mother at Church
Dykely.</i>]</h4>

<div class="blockquo1">
<p>Just half-a-dozen lines, my dear mother, for your eye alone: I enclose
them in my ordinary letter, meant for the world in general as well as
you. Mr. McAlpin knows <em>all</em>; but he was still anxious to make her
his wife. He thinks her the best and truest girl, excellent among
women. Praise from him <em>is</em> praise. It was, I am certain, a most
affecting interview; but they were alone. Mary&rsquo;s refusal&mdash;an absolute
one&mdash;was dictated by two motives. The one is that the old feelings
hold still so much sway in her heart (and, she says, always will) as to
render the idea of a union with any one else absolutely distasteful.
The other motive was consideration for Andrew McAlpin. &ldquo;I put it
to you what it would be,&rdquo; she said to him, &ldquo;if at any time after our
marriage, whether following closely upon it, or in years to come, this
story of mine should transpire? I should <em>die</em> with shame, with grief
for your sake: and there could be no remedy. No, no; never will I
subject you, or any one else, to that frightful chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, mother, she is right. In spite of Mr. McAlpin&rsquo;s present disappointment,
I know he thinks her so. It has but increased his
admiration for her. He said to me, &ldquo;Henceforth I shall look upon
her as a dear younger sister, and give her still my heart&rsquo;s best love and
reverence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And this is the private history of the affair: I thought I ought to
disclose it to you. Richard, while thinking she has done right, says it
is altogether an awful pity (he means inclusive of the past), for she&rsquo;s a
trump of a girl. And so she is.</p>

<p class="sgn"><span class="sign2">Ever yours, dear mother,</span><br />

<hr class="l3" />

<h3>Part the Third.</h3>

<p>It was a lovely place, that homestead of Chavasse Grange, as seen in
the freshness of the summer&rsquo;s morning: and my Lady Chavasse, looking
from her window as she dressed, might be thinking so. The green
lawn, its dew-drops sparkling in the sun, was dotted with beds of many
coloured flowers; the thrush and blackbird were singing in the surrounding
trees; the far-off landscape, stretched around in the distance,
was beautiful for the eye to rest upon.</p>

<p>Nearly hidden by great clusters of roses, some of which he was
plucking, and talking at the same time to the head-gardener who stood
by, was a good-looking gentleman of some five-and-twenty years. His
light morning coat was flung back from the snowy white waistcoat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
across which a gold chain passed, its seal drooping; a blue necktie, just
as blue as his blue eyes, was carelessly tied round his neck. He might
have been known for a Chavasse by those self-same eyes, for they had
been his father&rsquo;s&mdash;Sir Peter&rsquo;s&mdash;before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About those geraniums that you have put out, Markham,&rdquo; he was
saying. &ldquo;How came you to do it? Lady Chavasse is very angry;
she wanted them kept in the pots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sir Geoffry, I only obeyed orders,&rdquo; replied the gardener&mdash;who
was new to the place. &ldquo;Lady Rachel told me to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady Rachel did? Oh, very well. Lady Chavasse did not understand
that, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Up went Lady Chavasse&rsquo;s window at this juncture. &ldquo;Geoffry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Geoffry stepped out from the roses, and smiled as he answered
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask Markham about the geraniums, Geoffry&mdash;how he could dare to
do such a thing without orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother, Rachel bade him do it. Of course she did not know that
you wished it not done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; curtly replied Lady Chavasse. And she shut down the
window again.</p>

<p>By this it will be seen that the wishes of the two ladies at Chavasse
Grange sometimes clashed. Lady Rachel, though perhaps regarded as
second in authority, was fond of having her own way, and took it when
she could. Lady Chavasse made a show of deferring to her generally;
but she had reigned queen so long that she found it irksome, not to say
humiliating, to yield the smallest point to her son&rsquo;s wife.</p>

<p>They were sitting down to breakfast when Sir Geoffry went in, in
the room that had once been the garden-parlour. It had been re-embellished
since those days, and made the breakfast-room. Lady
Chavasse was but in her forty-fourth year; a young woman, so to say,
beautiful still, and excellently-well preserved. She wore a handsome
dress of green muslin, with a dainty little cap of lace on her rich
brown hair. Sir Geoffry&rsquo;s wife was in white; she looked just the same
as when she was Rachel Derreston; her perfect features pale, and cold,
and faultless.</p>

<p>Geoffry Chavasse laid a rose by the side of each as he sat down. <em>He</em>
was the only one changed; changed since the light-hearted days before
that episode of sin and care came to the Grange. It had soon passed
away again; but somehow it had left its mark on him. His face
seemed to have acquired a weary sort of look; and the fair bright
hair was getting somewhat thin upon the temples. Sir Geoffry was in
Parliament; but he had now paired off for the short remainder of the
session. Sometimes they were all in London: sometimes Sir Geoffry
would be there alone; or only with his wife: the Grange was their
chief and usual home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>They began talking of their plans for the day. Sir Geoffry had to
ride over some portion of the estate; Lady Rachel thought she must
write some letters; Lady Chavasse, who said her head ached, intended
to go out in her new carriage.</p>

<p>It was ordered to the door in the course of the morning: this pretty
toy carriage, which had been a recent present from Geoffry to his
mother. Low and lightly built, it was something like a basket-chaise,
but much more elegant, and the boy-groom, in his natty postillion&rsquo;s
dress, sat the horse. Lady Chavasse, a light shawl thrown over her
green muslin, and a white bonnet on, stood admiring the turn-out, her
maid, who had come out with the parasol, by her side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wilkins,&rdquo; said her ladyship, suddenly, &ldquo;run and ask Lady Rachel
whether she is sure she would not like to go with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman went and returned. &ldquo;Lady Rachel&rsquo;s love and thanks,
my lady, but she would prefer to get her letters done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Lady Chavasse went alone, taking the road to Church Dykely.
The hedges were blooming with wild roses and woodbine, the sweet
scent of the hay filled the air, the sky was blue and cloudless. But the
headache was making itself sensibly felt; and my lady, remembering
that she had often had these headaches lately, began wondering whether
Duffham the surgeon could give her anything to cure them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Giles,&rdquo; she cried, leaning forward. And the groom turned and
touched his cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Mr. Duffham&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So in the middle of the village, at Mr. Duffham&rsquo;s door, Giles pulled
up. The surgeon, seeing who it was, came out, and handed his visitor
indoors.</p>

<p>Lady Chavasse had not enjoyed a gossip with Mr. Duffham since
before her last absence from home. She rather liked one in her coldly
condescending way. And she stayed with him in the surgery while he
made up some medicine for her, and told her all the village news.
Then she began talking about her daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady Rachel seems well, but there is a little fractiousness perceptible
now and then; and I fancy that, with some people, it denotes
a state of not perfect health. There are <em>no</em> children, Mr. Duffham,
you see. There have been no signs of any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time enough for that, my lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;they have been married for&mdash;let me recollect&mdash;nearly fourteen
months. I do hope there will be children! I am anxious that
there should be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The surgeon happened to meet her eyes as she spoke, and read the
anxiety seated in them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see&mdash;if there were none, and anything happened to Sir Geoffry,
it would be the case of the old days&mdash;my case over again. Had my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
child proved to be a girl, the Grange would have gone from us. You
do not remember that; you were not here; but your predecessor, Mr.
Layne, knew all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the first time for some three or more years past that
Lady Chavasse had voluntarily mentioned the name of Layne to the
surgeon. It might have been a slip of the tongue now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But nothing is likely to happen to Sir Geoffry, Lady Chavasse,&rdquo;
observed Duffham, after an imperceptible pause. &ldquo;He is young and
healthy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know all that. Only it would be pleasant to feel we were on the
safe side&mdash;that there was a son to succeed. If anything did happen to
him, and he left no son, the Grange would pass away from us. I cannot
help looking to contingencies: it has been my way to do so all my
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Lady Chavasse, I sincerely hope the son will come. Sir
Geoffry is anxious on the point, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He makes no sign of being so. Sir Geoffry seems to me to have
grown a little indifferent in manner of late, as to general interests.
Yesterday afternoon we were talking about making some improvements
at the Grange, he and I; Lady Rachel was indoors at the piano. I
remarked that it would cost a good deal of money, and the question
was, whether it would be worth while to do it. &lsquo;My successor would
think it so, no doubt,&rsquo; cried Sir Geoffry. &lsquo;I hope that will never be
Parker Chavasse; I should not like him to reign here,&rsquo; I said hastily.
&lsquo;If it is, mother, I shall not be alive to witness it,&rsquo; was his unemotional
answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady Chavasse, considering the difference between the admiral&rsquo;s
age and Sir Geoffry&rsquo;s, I should say there are thirty chances against it,&rdquo;
was Duffham&rsquo;s reply, as he began to roll up the bottle of mixture in
white paper.</p>

<p>While he was doing this, a clapping of tiny hands attracted Lady
Chavasse&rsquo;s attention to the window, which stood open. A little boy
had run out of Mrs. Layne&rsquo;s door opposite, and stood on the pavement
in admiration of the carriage, which the groom was driving slowly
about. It was a pretty child of some three years old, or thereabouts,
in a brown holland pinafore strapped round the waist, his little arms
and legs and neck bare, and his light hair curling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, g&rsquo;andma, look! G&rsquo;andma, come and look!&rdquo; he cried&mdash;and the
words were wafted distinctly to Lady Chavasse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who <em>is</em> that child, Mr. Duffham? I have seen him sometimes
before. Stay, though, I remember&mdash;I think I have heard. He belongs
to that daughter of Mr. Layne&rsquo;s who married a soldier of the same
name. A lieutenant, or some grade of that kind, was he not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant Layne then: Captain Layne now,&rdquo; carelessly replied
Mr. Duffham. &ldquo;Hopes to get his majority in time, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed. I sometimes wonder how people devoid of family connections
manage to obtain rapid promotion. The grandmother takes
care of the child, I suppose. Quite a charge for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Duffham, standing now by her side, glanced at Lady Chavasse.
Her countenance was open, unembarrassed: there was no sign of
ulterior thought upon it. Evidently a certain event of the past was
not just then in her remembrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is the old lady?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Middling. She breaks fast. I doubt, though, if one of her
daughters will not go before her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Chavasse turned quickly at the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I speak of the one who is with her&mdash;Miss Elizabeth Layne,&rdquo; continued
Mr. Duffham, busily rolling up the bottle. &ldquo;Her health is
failing: I think seriously; though she may linger for some time yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a pause. Lady Chavasse looked hard at the white knobs
on the drug-drawers. But that she began to speak, old Duffham might
have thought she was counting how many there were of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other one&mdash;Miss Mary Layne&mdash;is she still in that situation in
India? A governess, or something of the kind, we heard she went out
to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Governess to Captain Layne&rsquo;s children. Oh yes, she&rsquo;s there. And
likely to be, the people over the way seem to say. Captain and Mrs.
Layne consider that they have a treasure in her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I make no doubt she would do her duty. Thank you; never
mind sealing it. I will be sure to attend to your directions, Mr.
Duffham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She swept out to the carriage, which had now drawn up, and stepped
over the low step into it. The surgeon put the bottle by her side, and
saluted her as she drove away. Across the road trotted the little
fellow in the pinafore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did oo see dat booful tarriage, Mis&rsquo;er Duffham? I&rsquo;d like to &rsquo;ide
in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would, would you, Master Arthur,&rdquo; returned the surgeon,
hoisting the child for a moment on his shoulder, and then setting him
on his feet again, as Miss Layne appeared at the door. &ldquo;Be off back:
there&rsquo;s Aunt Elizabeth looking angry. It&rsquo;s against the law, you know,
sir, to run out beyond the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the little lad ran over at once, obediently.</p>

<p>Nearly three years back&mdash;not quite so much by two or three months&mdash;Church
Dykely was gratified by the intelligence that Captain Layne&rsquo;s
wife&mdash;then sojourning in Europe&mdash;was coming on a short visit to her
mother with her three or four weeks&rsquo; old baby. Church Dykely
welcomed the news, for it was a sort of break to the monotonous, jog-trot
village life, and warmly received Mrs. Richard Layne and the
child on their arrival. The infant was born in France, where Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Richard Layne had been staying with one of her sisters&mdash;Mary&mdash;and
whence she had now come direct to her mother&rsquo;s; Mary having gone
on to Liverpool to join Mrs. Richard Layne&rsquo;s other children. The
baby&mdash;made much of by the neighbours&mdash;was to remain with old Mrs.
Layne: Mrs. Richard Layne did not deem it well to take so young a
child to India, as he seemed rather delicate. Church Dykely said how
generous it was of her to sacrifice her motherly feelings for the baby&rsquo;s
good&mdash;but the Laynes had always been unselfish. She departed,
leaving the child. And Baby Arthur, as all the place called him, lived
and thrived, and was now grown as fine a little fellow for his age as
might be, with a generous spirit and open heart. My Lady Chavasse
(having temporarily forgotten it when speaking with Mr. Duffham) had
heard all about the child&rsquo;s parentage just as the village had&mdash;that he
was the son of Captain Richard Layne and his wife Susan. Chavasse
Grange generally understood the same, including Sir Geoffry. There
was no intercourse whatever between the Layne family and the
Grange; there had not been any since Miss Mary Layne quitted it.
My Lady Chavasse was in the habit of turning away her eyes when
she passed Mrs. Layne&rsquo;s house: and in good truth, though perhaps her
conscience reminded her of it at these moments, she had three-parts forgotten
the unpleasant episode of the past.</p>

<p>And the little boy grew and thrived: and became as much a feature
in Church Dykely as other features were&mdash;say the bridge over the
mill-stream, or the butcher&rsquo;s wife&mdash;and was no more thought of, in the
matter of speculation, than they were.</p>

<p>Miss Elizabeth Layne caught hold of the young truant&rsquo;s hand with a
jerk and a reprimand, telling him he would be run over some day.
She had occasion to tell it him rather often, for he was of a fearless
nature. Mr. Duffham nodded across the road to Miss Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you better to-day?&rdquo; he called out. People don&rsquo;t stand on
ceremony in these rural places.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much, thank you,&rdquo; came the answer.</p>

<p>For Miss Elizabeth Layne had been anything but strong lately: her
symptoms being very like those that herald consumption.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>The time rolled on, bringing its changes. You have already seen it
rolling on in Calcutta, for in this, the third part, we have had to go
back a year or two.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Layne died. Mrs. Layne grew very feeble, and it was
thought and said by every one that one of her daughters ought to be
residing with her. There was only one left unmarried&mdash;Mary. Mary
received news in India of this state of things at home, together with
a summons from her mother. Not at all a peremptory summons.
Mrs. Layne wrote a few shaky lines, praying her to come &ldquo;if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
would not mind returning to the place:&rdquo; if she did mind it, why, she,
the mother, must die alone as she best could. There was a short
struggle in Mary Layne&rsquo;s heart; a quick, sharp battle, and she gave in.
Her duty to her mother lay before aught else in God&rsquo;s sight; and she
would yield to it. As soon as preparations for her voyage could be
made, she embarked for England.</p>

<p>It was autumn when she got home, and Church Dykely received her
gladly. Mary Layne had always been a favourite in the place, from
the time her father, the good-hearted, hard-working surgeon, had
fondly shown her, his youngest and fairest child, to the public, a baby
of a few days old. But Church Dykely found her greatly changed.
They remembered her as a blooming girl; she came back to them a
grave woman, looking older than her years, and with a pale sweet
countenance that seemed never to have a smile on it. She was only
six-and-twenty yet.</p>

<p>Miss Layne took up her post at once by the side of her ailing mother.
What with attending her and attending to Baby Arthur&mdash;whom she
took into training at once, just as she had taken the children in
India&mdash;she found her time fully occupied. The boy, when she returned,
was turned five. She went out very rarely; never&mdash;except to
church, or at dusk&mdash;when the family were at the Grange, for she
seemed to have a dread of meeting them. Church Dykely wondered
that Miss Layne did not call at the Grange, considering that she had
been humble companion there before she went out, or that my lady did
not come to see her; but supposed the lapse of time had caused the
acquaintanceship to fall through.</p>

<p>Mary had brought good news from India. Her sister Eleanor, Mrs.
Allan McAlpin, had a little girl, to the great delight of all concerned.
Just when they had given it up as hopeless, the capricious infant
arrived. Major Layne told his wife confidentially that Allan McAlpin
was prouder of that baby than any dog with two tails.</p>

<p>And henceforth this was to be Mary Layne&rsquo;s home, and this her
occupation&mdash;caring for her mother, so long as the old lady should be
spared, and gently leading to good the child, Arthur. Mrs. Layne,
lapsing into her dotage, would sit in her favourite place, the parlour
window, open when the weather allowed it, watching people as they
passed. Mary&rsquo;s smooth and bright brown hair might be seen in the
background, her head drooping over the book she was reading to Mrs.
Layne, or over her work when the old lady grew tired of listening, or
over Master Arthur&rsquo;s lessons at the table. Not only lessons to fit him
for this world did Mary teach him; but such as would stand him in
good aid when striving onwards for the next. Twice a day, morning
and evening, would she take the child alone, and talk to him of heaven,
and things pertaining to it. Aunt Elizabeth&rsquo;s lessons had been chiefly
on the score of behaviour: the other sort of instruction had been all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
routine, at the best. Mary remedied this, and she had an apt little
scholar. Seated on her knee, his bright blue eyes turned up to her
face, the child would listen and talk, and say he would be a good boy
always, always. The tears wet his eyelashes at her Bible stories: he
would put his little face down on her bosom, and whisper out a sobbing
wish that Jesus would love <em>him</em> as He had loved the little children on
earth. There is no safeguard like this seed sown in childhood: if
withheld, nothing can replace it in after-life.</p>

<p>They grew the best and greatest friends, these two. Whether Mary
loved him, or not, she did not say; she was ever patient and thoughtful
with him, with a kind of grave tenderness. But the child grew to
love her more than he had ever loved any one in his young life. One
day, when he did something wrong and saw how it grieved her, his
repentant sobs nearly choked him. It was very certain that Mary had
found the way to his heart, and might mould him for good or for ill.</p>

<p>The child was a chatterbox. Aunt Elizabeth used to say he ought
to have the tip of his tongue cut off. He seemed never tired of asking
about papa and mamma in India, and Allan and Bobby and the rest,
and the elephants and camels&mdash;and Dick the eldest, who was in
London, at the school attached to King&rsquo;s College.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When will they come over to see us, Aunt Mary?&rdquo; he questioned
one day, when he was on Mary&rsquo;s knee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If grandmamma&rsquo;s pretty well we, will have Dick down at Christmas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Dick to be a soldier like papa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be a soldier too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was an involuntary tightening of her hands round him&mdash;as if
she would guard him from <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not, Arthur. One soldier in a family&rsquo;s enough: and that is
to be Richard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is papa a very big, big brave man, with a flashing sword?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Major Layne is tall and very brave. He wears his sword sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Mary, I should like to be a soldier and have a sword!
When I can write well enough I&rsquo;ll write a letter to papa to ask him.
I&rsquo;d like to ride on the elephants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are not as good to ride as horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is mamma as pretty as you?&rdquo; demanded Master Arthur, after a
pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prettier. I am pale and&mdash;&rdquo; sad, she was going to say, but put
another word&mdash;&ldquo;quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you go back to India, Aunt Mary, shall you take me? I
should like to sail in the great ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arthur dear, I do not think I shall go back.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>And so Miss Mary Layne&mdash;she was Miss Layne now&mdash;stayed on.
Church Dykely would see a slender, grave young lady, dressed generally
in black silk, whose sweet face seemed to have too careworn an expression
for her years. But if her countenance was worn and weary, her
heart was not. That seemed full of love and charity for all; of gentle
compassion for any wrong-doer, of sympathy for the sick and suffering.
She grew to be revered, and valued, and respected as few had ever
been in Church Dykely: certainly as none had, so young as she was.
Baby Arthur, clacking his whip as he went through the streets on his
walks by the nurse Betsy&rsquo;s side, his chattering tongue never still; now
running into the blacksmith&rsquo;s shed to watch the sparks; now perching
himself on the top of the village stocks; and now frightening Betsy out
of her senses by attempting to leap the brook&mdash;in spite of these outdoor
attractions, Baby Arthur was ever ready to run home to Aunt Mary, as
though she were his best treasure.</p>

<p>When Miss Layne had been about six months at her mother&rsquo;s, a
piece of munificent good fortune befel her&mdash;as conveyed to her in official
and unofficial communications from India. Andrew McAlpin&mdash;the head
of the great McAlpin house in Calcutta, who had respected Mary Layne
above all women, and had wished to marry her, as may be remembered&mdash;Andrew
McAlpin was dead, and had left some of his accumulated
wealth to Mary. It would amount to six hundred a-year, and was
bequeathed to her absolutely: at her own disposal to will away when
she in turn should die. In addition to this, he directed that the sum of
one thousand pounds should be paid to her at once. He also left a
thousand pounds to Mrs. Richard Layne&mdash;but that does not concern us.
This good man&rsquo;s death brought great grief to Mary. It had been the
result of an accident: he lay ill only a few weeks. As to the fortune&mdash;well,
of course that was welcome, for Mary had been casting many an
anxious thought to the future on sundry scores, and what little money
she had been able to put by, out of the salary as governess at Major
Layne&rsquo;s, was now nearly exhausted. She thought she knew why Mr.
McAlpin had thus generously remembered her: and it was an additional
proof of the thoughtful goodness which had ever characterized his life.
Oh, if she could only have thanked him! if she had only known it
before he died! He had been in the habit of corresponding with her
since her return to Europe, for she and he had remained firm friends,
but the thought of ever benefiting by him in this way had never entered
her head. As how should it?&mdash;seeing that he was a strong man, and
only in the prime of life. She mourned his loss: she thought she
could best have spared any other friend; but all the regrets in the
world would not bring him back to life. He was gone. And Allan
McAlpin was now sole head of that wealthy house, besides inheriting
a vast private fortune from his brother. Eleanor McAlpin, once Eleanor
Layne, might well wish for more children amidst all her riches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>The first thing that Mary Layne did with some of this thousand
pounds&mdash;which had been conveyed to her simultaneously with the
tidings of the death&mdash;was to convey her mother to the seaside for a
change, together with Baby Arthur and the nurse, Betsy. Before
quitting home she held one or two interviews with James Spriggings,
the house agent, builder, and decorator, and left certain orders with
him. On their return, old Mrs. Layne did not know her house. It
had been put into substantial repair inside and out, and was now one
of the prettiest, not to say handsomest, in the village. All the old
carpets were replaced by handsome new ones, and a great deal of the
furniture was new. Pillars had been added to the rather small door,
giving it an imposing appearance, iron outside railings had taken the
place of the old ones. Mrs. Layne, I say, did not know her house
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, why have you done it?&rdquo; cried the old lady, looking
about her in amazement. &ldquo;Is it not a waste of money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not, mother,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Most likely this will be
my home for life. Perhaps Arthur&rsquo;s home after me. At least it will
be his until he shall be of an age to go out in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Layne said no more. She had grown of late very indifferent
to outward things. Aged people do get so, and Mr. Duffham said her
system was breaking up. The seaside air had done her good; they
had gone to it in May, and came back in August. Mary added a third
servant to the household, and things went on as before in their quiet
routine.</p>

<p>One afternoon in September, when they had been at home about a
month, Mary went out, and took Arthur. She was going to see a poor
cottager who had nursed herself, Mary, when she was a child, and who
had recently lost her husband. When they came to the gates of
Chavasse Grange, past which their road lay, Master Arthur made a
dead standstill, and wholly declined to proceed. The child was in
a black velvet tunic, the tips of his white drawers just discernible
beneath it, and his legs bare, down to the white socks: boys of his age
were dressed so then. As bonny a lad for his six years as could be
seen anywhere, with a noble, fearless bearing. Mary wore her usual
black silk, a rich one too, with a little crape on it; the mourning for
Mr. McAlpin. Arthur was staring over the way through the open gates
of the Grange.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to go in and see the peacock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go in and see the peacock!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Layne, rather taken
aback by the demand. &ldquo;What can you mean, Arthur? The peacock
is up by the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it is. We can go up there and see it, Aunt Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed we cannot, Arthur. I never heard of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betsy lets me go.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>The confession involved all sorts of thoughts, and a flush crossed
Miss Layne&rsquo;s delicate face. The family were not at the Grange, as she
knew: they had gone up to London in January, when Parliament
met, and had never returned since: nevertheless she did not like to
hear of this intrusion into the grounds of the nurse and child. The
peacock had been a recent acquisition; or, as Arthur expressed it, had
just &ldquo;come to live there.&rdquo; When he had talked of it at home, Mary
supposed he had seen it on the slopes in passing. These green slopes,
dotted here and there with shrubs and flowers, came down to the
boundary wall that skirted the highway. The avenue through the
gates wound round abruptly, hiding itself beyond the lodge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, my dear. It is already late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Aunt Mary, you <em>must</em> see the peacock. He has got the most
splendid tail. Sometimes he drags it behind him on the grass, and
sometimes it&rsquo;s all spread out in a beautiful circle, like that fan you
brought home from India. Do come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Layne did not reply for the moment. She was inwardly debating
upon what plea she could forbid the child&rsquo;s ever going in again
to see the peacock: the interdiction would sound most arbitrary if she
gave none. All at once, as if by magic, the peacock appeared in view,
strutting down the slopes, its proud tail, in all its glory, spread out in
the rays of the declining sun.</p>

<p>It was too much for Arthur. With a shout of delight he leaped off
the low foot-path, flew across the road, and in at the gates. In vain
Mary called: in his glad excitement he did not so much as hear her.</p>

<p>There ensued a noise as of the fleet foot of a horse, and then a crash,
a man&rsquo;s shout, and a child&rsquo;s cry. What harm had been done? In
dire fear Mary Layne ran to see, her legs trembling beneath her.</p>

<p>Just at the sharp turn beyond the lodge, a group stood: Sir Geoffry
Chavasse had Arthur in his arms; his horse, from which he had flung
himself, being held and soothed by a mounted groom. The lodge
children also had come running out to look. She understood it in a
moment: Sir Geoffry must have been riding quickly down from the
house, his groom behind him, when the unfortunate little intruder encountered
him just at the turn, and there was no possibility of pulling
up in time. In fact, the boy had run absolutely on to the horse&rsquo;s legs.</p>

<p>She stood, white, and faint, and sick against the wall of the lodge:
not daring to look into the accident&mdash;for Mary Layne was but a true
woman, timid and sensitive; as little daring to encounter Sir Geoffry
Chavasse, whom she had not been close to but for a few months short
of seven years. That it should have occurred!&mdash;that this untoward
thing should have occurred!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder whose child it is?&rdquo; she heard Sir Geoffry say&mdash;and the
well-remembered tones came home to her with a heart-thrill. &ldquo;Poor
little fellow! could it have been my fault, or his? Dovey&rdquo;&mdash;to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
groom&mdash;&ldquo;ride on at once and get Mr. Duffham here. Never mind my
horse; he&rsquo;s all right now. You can lead him up to the house, Bill,
my lad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The groom touched his hat, and rode past Mary on his errand. Sir
Geoffry was already carrying the child to the Grange; Bill, the eldest
of the lodge children, following with the horse. All in a minute, a
wailing cry burst from Arthur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Mary! Aunt Mary! Oh, please let her come! I want
Aunt Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then it struck Sir Geoffry Chavasse that a gentleman&rsquo;s child,
such as this one by his appearance evidently was, would not have been
out without an attendant. He turned round, and saw a lady in black
standing by the lodge. The wailing cry began again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Mary! I want Aunt Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no help for it. She came on with her agitated face, from
which every drop of blood had faded. Sir Geoffry, occupied with the
child, did not notice her much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so grieved,&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;I trust the injury will be found not
to be very serious. My horse&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had lifted his eyes then, and knew her instantly. His own face
turned crimson; the words he had been about to say died unspoken on
his lips. For a moment they looked in each other&rsquo;s faces, and might
have seen, had the time been one of less agitation, how markedly
sorrow had left its traces there. The next, they remembered the
present time, and what was due from them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon: Miss Layne, I think?&rdquo; said Sir Geoffry, contriving
to release one hand and raise his hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she answered, and bowed in return.</p>

<p>He sat down on the bank for a moment to obtain a better hold of the
child. Blood was dripping from one of the little velvet sleeves. Sir
Geoffry, carrying him as gently as was possible, made all haste to the
house. The window of what had been the garden-parlour stood open,
and he took him into it at once. Ah, how they both remembered it.
It had been refurnished and embellished now: but the room was the
room still. Sir Geoffry had returned home that morning. His wife
and Lady Chavasse were not expected for a day or two. Scarcely any
servants were as yet in the house; but the woman who had been left in
charge, Hester Picker, came in with warm water. She curtsied to
Miss Layne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear little fellow!&rdquo; she exclaimed, her tongue ready as of old.
&ldquo;How did it happen, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My horse knocked him down,&rdquo; replied Sir Geoffry. &ldquo;Get me some
linen, Picker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy lay on the sofa where he had been put, his hat off, and his
pretty light brown hair falling from his face, pale now. Apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
there was no injury except to the arm. Sir Geoffry looked at
Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a bit of a surgeon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will you allow me to examine
his hurt as a surgeon would? Duffham cannot be here just yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, certainly,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must cut his velvet sleeve up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she bowed in acquiescence to that.</p>

<p>Hester Picker came in with the linen. Before commencing to cut the
sleeve, Sir Geoffry touched the arm here and there, as if testing where
the damage might lie. Arthur cried out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That hurts you,&rdquo; said Sir Geoffry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; answered the little fellow, trying to be brave. &ldquo;Papa&rsquo;s
a soldier, and I want to be a soldier, so I won&rsquo;t mind a little hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your papa&rsquo;s a soldier? Ah, yes, I think I remember,&rdquo; said Sir
Geoffry, turning to Mary. &ldquo;It is the little son of Captain Layne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My papa is Major Layne now,&rdquo; spoke up Arthur, before she could
make any answer. &ldquo;He and mamma live in India.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you want to be a soldier, the same as papa?&rdquo; said Sir
Geoffry, testing the basin of water with his finger, which Picker was
holding, and which had been brought in very hot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. Aunt Mary there says No, and grandmamma says No;
but&mdash;oh, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had caught sight of the blood for the first time, and broke off with
a shuddering cry. Sir Geoffry was ready now, and had the scissors in
his hand. But before using them he spoke to Miss Layne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you sit here whilst I look at it?&rdquo; he asked, putting a chair
with its face to the open window, and its back to the sofa. And she
understood the motive and thanked him: and said she would walk
about outside.</p>

<p>By-and-by, when she was tired of waiting, and all seemed very quiet,
she looked in. Arthur had fainted. Sir Geoffry was bathing his forehead
with eau-de-Cologne; Picker had run for something in a tumbler
and wine stood on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it the pain?&mdash;did it hurt him very badly?&rdquo; asked Mary, supposing
that the arm had been bathed and perhaps dressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not done anything to it; I preferred to leave it for Duffham,&rdquo;
said Sir Geoffry&mdash;and at the same moment she caught sight of the
velvet sleeve laid open, and something lying on it that looked like a
mass of linen. Mary turned even whiter than the child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not be alarmed,&rdquo; said Sir Geoffry. &ldquo;Your little nephew is only
faint from the loss of blood. Drink this,&rdquo; he added, bringing her a glass
of wine.</p>

<p>But she would not take it. As Sir Geoffry was putting it on the
table, Arthur began to revive. Young children are elastic&mdash;ill one
minute, well the next; and he began to talk again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Mary, are you there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She moved to the sofa, and took his uninjured hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must not tell grandmamma, Aunt Mary. It would frighten her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless his dear little thoughtful heart!&rdquo; interjected Hester Picker.
&ldquo;Here comes something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The something proved to be a fly, and it brought Mr. Duffham.
Before the groom had reached the village, he overtook this said fly and
the surgeon in it, who was then returning home from another accident.
Turning round at the groom&rsquo;s news&mdash;&ldquo;Some little child had run
against Sir Geoffry&rsquo;s horse, and was hurt&rdquo;&mdash;he came up to the Grange.</p>

<p>When Mr. Duffham saw that it was <em>this</em> child, he felt curiously taken
aback. Up the room and down the room looked he; then at Sir Geoffry,
then at Miss Layne, then at Hester Picker, saying nothing. Last of all
he walked up to the sofa and gazed at the white face lying there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and what&rsquo;s this? And how did it happen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the peacock,&rdquo; Arthur answered. &ldquo;I ran away from Aunt
Mary to look at it, and the horse came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dear innocent!&rdquo; cried Hester Picker. &ldquo;No wonder he ran.
It&rsquo;s a love of a peacock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it was very naughty, young sir, to run from your
aunt?&rdquo; returned Mr. Duffham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, very; because she had told me not to. Aunt Mary, I&rsquo;ll never
do it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two gentlemen and Hester Picker remained in the room; Mary
again left it. The arm was crushed rather badly; and Mr. Duffham
knew it would require care and skill to cure it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must send to Worcester for its best surgeon to help you,&rdquo; said
the baronet, when the dressing was over. &ldquo;I feel that I am responsible
to Major Layne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Old Duffham nearly closed his eyelids as he glanced at the speaker.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it necessary,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;no surgeon can do more than I
can. However, it may be satisfactory to Major Layne that we should
be on the safe side, so I&rsquo;ll send.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the child was ready, Mary got into the fly, which had waited,
and Mr. Duffham put him to lie on her lap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope, Miss Layne, I may be allowed to call to-morrow and see
how he gets on,&rdquo; said Sir Geoffry, at the same time. And she did not
feel that it was possible for her to say No. Mr. Duffham mounted
beside the driver; to get a sniff, he said, of the evening air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How he is changed! He has suffered as I have,&rdquo; murmured Mary
Layne to herself, as her tears fell on Baby Arthur, asleep now. &ldquo;I am
very thankful that he has no suspicion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child had said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell grandmamma;&rdquo; but to keep it from
Mrs. Layne was simply impossible. With the first stopping of the fly
at the door, out came the old lady; she had been marvelling what had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
become of them, and was wanting her tea. Mr. Duffham took her in
again, and said a few words, making light of it, before he lifted out
Baby Arthur.</p>

<p>A skilful surgeon was at the house the next day, in conjunction with
Mr. Duffham. The arm and its full use would be saved, he said; its
cure effected; but the child and those about him must have patience,
for it might be rather a long job. Arthur said he should like to write
to his papa in India, and tell him that it was his own fault for running
away from Aunt Mary; he could write letters in big text hand. The
surgeon smiled, and told him he must wait until he could use both
arms again.</p>

<p>The doctors had not left the house many minutes when Sir Geoffry
Chavasse called, having walked over from the Grange. Miss Layne
sent her mother to receive him, and disappeared herself. The old lady,
her perceptions a little dulled with time and age, and perhaps also her
memory, felt somewhat impressed and flattered at the visit. To her it
almost seemed the honour that it used to be: that one painful episode
of the past seemed to be as much forgotten at the moment as though it
had never had place. She took Sir Geoffry upstairs.</p>

<p>Arthur was lying close to the window, in the strong light of the fine
morning. It was the first clear view Sir Geoffry had obtained of him.
The garden-parlour at the Grange faced the east, so that the room on
the previous evening, being turned from the setting sun, had been shady
at the best, and the sofa was at the far end of it. As Sir Geoffry gazed
at the child now, the face struck him as being like somebody&rsquo;s; he
could not tell whose. The dark blue eyes especially, turned up in all
their eager brightness to his, seemed quite familiar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says I must not write to papa until I get well,&rdquo; said Arthur,
who had begun to look on Sir Geoffry as an old acquaintance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who does?&rdquo; asked the baronet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman who came with Mr. Duffham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He means the doctor from Worcester, Sir Geoffry,&rdquo; put in old Mrs.
Layne. She was sitting in her easy-chair near, as she had been previously;
her spectacles keeping the place between the leaves of the
closed Bible, which she had again taken on her lap; her withered hands,
in their black lace mittens and frilled white ruffles, were crossed upon
the Book. Every now and then she nodded with incipient sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so very sorry this should have happened,&rdquo; Sir Geoffry said,
turning to Mrs. Layne. &ldquo;The little fellow was running up to get a
look at the peacock, it seems; and I was riding rather fast. I shall
never ride fast round that corner again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Sir Geoffry, they tell me that the child ran right against you
at the corner: that it was no fault of yours at all, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was my fault, grandmamma,&rdquo; said Arthur. &ldquo;And, Sir Geoffry,
that&rsquo;s why I wanted to write to papa; I want to tell him so.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I had better write for you,&rdquo; said Sir Geoffry, looking down
at the boy with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you? Shall you tell him it was my fault?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I shall tell him it was mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it was not yours. You must not write what is not true. If
Aunt Mary thought I could tell a story, or write one, oh, I don&rsquo;t know
what she&rsquo;d do. God hears all we say, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Geoffry smiled&mdash;a sad smile&mdash;at the earnest words, at the eager
look in the bright eyes. Involuntarily the wish came into his mind
that <em>he</em> had a brave, fearless-hearted, right-principled son, such as this
boy evidently was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I think I had better describe how it happened, and let Major
Layne judge for himself whether it was my fast riding or your fast
running that caused the mischief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell about the peacock? It had its tail out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll tell about the peacock. I shall say to Major Layne
that his little boy&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I have heard your name,&rdquo; broke off
Sir Geoffry. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Arthur. Papa&rsquo;s is Richard. My big brother&rsquo;s is Richard too;
he is at King&rsquo;s College. Which name do you like best?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I like Arthur best. It is my own name also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yours is Sir Geoffry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Arthur as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But at this juncture old Mrs. Layne, having started up from a nod,
interposed to put a summary stop to the chatter, telling Arthur crossly
that Mr. Duffham and the other doctor had forbid him to talk much.
And then she begged pardon of Sir Geoffry for saying it, but thought
the doctors wished the child to be kept quiet and cool. Sir Geoffry
took the opportunity to say adieu to the little patient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I come to see the peacock when I get well, Sir Geoffry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. You shall come and look at him for a whole day if
grandmamma will allow you to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grandmamma gave no motion or word of assent, but Arthur took it
for granted. &ldquo;Betsy can bring me if Aunt Mary won&rsquo;t; Betsy&rsquo;s my
nurse. I wish I could have him before that window to look at while I
lie here to get well. I like peacocks and musical boxes better than
anything in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Musical boxes!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Geoffry. &ldquo;Do you care for them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; they are beautiful. Do you know the little lame boy who
can&rsquo;t walk, down Piefinch Cut? His father comes to do grandmamma&rsquo;s
garden. Do you know him, Sir Geoffry? His name&rsquo;s
Reuben.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Noah, the gardener&rsquo;s son, sir,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Layne aside to Sir
Geoffry. &ldquo;He was thrown downstairs when a baby, and has been a
cripple ever since.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>But the eager, intelligent eyes were still cast up, waiting for the
answer. &ldquo;Where <em>have</em> I seen them?&rdquo; mentally debated Sir Geoffry,
alluding to the eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know the name?&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Reuben has got a musical box, and it plays three tunes.
He is older than I am: he&rsquo;s ten. One of them is &lsquo;The Blue Bells of
Scotland.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Geoffry nodded and went away. He crossed straight over to Mr.
Duffham&rsquo;s, and found him writing a letter in his surgery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope the child will do well,&rdquo; said the baronet, when he had
shaken hands. &ldquo;I have just been to see him. What an intelligent,
nice little fellow it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he will be all right again in time, Sir Geoffry,&rdquo; was the doctor&rsquo;s
reply, as he began to fold his letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a pretty boy, too, very. His eyes are strangely like some
one&rsquo;s I have seen, but for the life of me I cannot tell whose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Really?</em>&mdash;do you mean it?&rdquo; cried Mr. Duffham, speaking, as it
seemed, in some surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mean what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you cannot tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I can&rsquo;t. They puzzled me all the while I was there. Do
you know? Say, if you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are like your own, Sir Geoffry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like my own!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are your own eyes over again. And yours&mdash;as poor Layne used
to say, and as the picture in the Grange dining-room shows us also,
for the matter of that&mdash;are Sir Peter&rsquo;s. Sir Peter&rsquo;s, yours, and the
child&rsquo;s: they are all the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a long space of time, as it seemed, the two gentlemen gazed at
each other. Mr. Duffham with a questioning and still surprised look:
Sir Geoffry in a kind of bewildered amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Duffham! you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash; Surely it is not <em>that</em> child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He backed to a chair and stumbled into it, rather than sat down;
somewhat in the same manner that Mrs. Layne had backed against the
counter nearly seven years before and upset the scales. The old lady
seemed to have aged since quicker than she ought to have done: but
her face then had not been whiter than was Geoffry Chavasse&rsquo;s now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dead silence was only broken by these murmured words that
fell from his lips. Mr. Duffham finished folding his note, and directed
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Geoffry, I beg your pardon! I beg it a thousand times. If I
had had the smallest notion that you were ignorant of this, I should
never have spoken.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Geoffry took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow. Some
moisture had gathered there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was I to suspect it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never supposed but that you must have known it all along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All along from when, Duffham?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From&mdash;from&mdash;well, from the time you first knew that a child was
over there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Geoffry cast his thoughts back. He could not remember anything
about the child&rsquo;s coming to Church Dykely. In point of fact,
the Grange had been empty at the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understood that the child was one of Captain and Mrs. Layne&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
he rejoined. &ldquo;Every one said it; and I never had any other
thought. Even yesterday at the Grange you spoke of him as such,
Duffham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. Miss Layne was present&mdash;and Hester Picker&mdash;and the
child himself. I did not speak to deceive you, Sir Geoffry. When
you said what you did to me in coming away, about calling in other
advice for the satisfaction of Major Layne, I thought you were merely
keeping up appearances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it <em>is</em> so, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another pause. Mr. Duffham affixed the stamp to his letter, and
put the paper straight in his note-case. Sir Geoffry suddenly lifted his
hand, as one whom some disagreeable reflection overwhelms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think that I was about to write to Major Layne! To think
that I should have stood there, in the old lady&rsquo;s presence, talking
boldly with the child! She must assume that I have the impudence of
Satan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Layne is past that, Sir Geoffry. Her faculties are dulled:
three-parts dead. <em>That</em> need not trouble you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The baronet put aside his handkerchief and took up his hat to leave.
He began stroking its nap with his coat-sleeve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does my mother know of this, do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure she neither knows nor suspects it. No one does, Sir
Geoffry: the secret has been entirely kept.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cost of this illness must be mine, you know, Duffham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not, Sir Geoffry,&rdquo; was the surgeon&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;It would
not do, I fear. There&rsquo;s no need, besides: Miss Layne is rich now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rich! How is she rich?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Mr. Duffham had to explain. A wealthy gentleman in India,
some connection of the Laynes, had died and left money to Mary
Layne. Six or seven hundred a year; and plenty of ready means.
Sir Geoffry Chavasse went out, pondering upon the world&rsquo;s changes.</p>

<p>He did not call to see the invalid again; but he bought a beautiful
musical box at Worcester, and sent it in to the child by Duffham. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
played six tunes. The boy had never in his life been so delighted.
He returned his love and thanks to Sir Geoffry; and appended several
inquiries touching the welfare of the peacock.</p>

<p>The first news heard by Lady Chavasse and Lady Rachel on their
coming home, was of the accident caused to Major Layne&rsquo;s little son
by Sir Geoffry&rsquo;s horse. Hester Picker and the other servants were full
of it. It happened to be the day that Sir Geoffry had gone to Worcester
after the box, so he could not join in the narrative. A sweet, beautiful
boy, said Hester to my ladies, and had told them he meant to be a
soldier when he grew up, as brave as his papa. Lady Chavasse,
having digested the news, and taken inward counsel with herself,
decided to go and see him: it would be right and neighbourly, she
thought. It might be that she was wishing to bestow some slight
mark of her favour upon the old lady before death should claim her:
and she deemed that the honour of a call would effect this. In her
heart she acknowledged that the Laynes had behaved admirably in
regard to the past; never to have troubled her or her son by word or
deed or letter; and in her heart she felt grateful for it. Some people
might have acted differently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I will go and see him too,&rdquo; said Lady Rachel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, pray don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; dissented Lady Chavasse, hastily. &ldquo;You already
feel the fatigue of your journey, Rachel: do not attempt to increase it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as Lady Rachel really was fatigued and did not care much about
it, one way or the other, she remained at home.</p>

<p>It was one of Mrs. Layne&rsquo;s worst days&mdash;one of those when she
seemed three-parts childish&mdash;when Lady Chavasse was shown into the
drawing-room. Mary was there. As she turned to receive her visitor,
and heard the maid&rsquo;s announcement &ldquo;Lady Chavasse,&rdquo; a great astonishment
inwardly stirred her, but her manner remained quiet and self-possessed.
Just a minute&rsquo;s gaze at each other. Lady Chavasse was
the same good-looking woman as of yore; not changed, not aged by so
much as a day. Mary <em>was</em> changed: the shy, inexperienced girl had
grown into the calm, self-contained woman; the woman who had
known sorrow, who had its marks impressed on her face. She had
been pretty once, she was gravely beautiful now. Perhaps Lady
Chavasse had not bargained for seeing <em>her</em>; Mary had certainly never
thought thus to meet Lady Chavasse: but here they were, face to face,
and each must make the best of it. As they did; and with easy
courtesy, both being gentlewomen. Lady Chavasse held out her hand,
and Mary put hers into it.</p>

<p>After shaking hands with Mrs. Layne&mdash;who was too drowsy properly
to respond, and shut her eyes again&mdash;my lady spoke a few pleasant
words of regret for the accident, of her wish to see the little patient, of
her hope that Major and Mrs. Layne might not be allowed to think any
care on Sir Geoffry&rsquo;s part could have averted it. Mary went upstairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
with her. Lady Chavasse could only be struck with the improved
appearance of the house, quite suited now to be the abode of gentle-people;
and with its apparently well-appointed if small household.</p>

<p>The child lay asleep: his nurse, Betsy, sat sewing by his side. The
girl confessed that she had allowed him sometimes to run in and take a
look at the peacock. Lady Chavasse would not have him awakened:
she bent and kissed his cheek lightly: and talked to Mary in a whisper.
It was just as though there had been no break in their acquaintanceship,
just as though no painful episode, in which they were antagonistic
actors, had ever occurred between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear you have come into a fortune, Miss Layne,&rdquo; she said, as she
shook hands with Mary again in the little hall before departure. For
Hester Picker had told of this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Into a great deal of money,&rdquo; replied Mary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it: <em>glad</em>,&rdquo; came the parting response, whispered
emphatically in Mary&rsquo;s ear, and it was accompanied by a pressure of
the fingers.</p>

<p>Mr. Duffham was standing at his door, watching my lady&rsquo;s exit from
Mrs. Layne&rsquo;s house, his eyes lost in wonder. Seeing him, she crossed
over, and went in, Mr. Duffham throwing open the door of his sitting-room.
She began speaking of the accident to Major Layne&rsquo;s little son&mdash;what
a pity it was, but that she hoped he would do well. Old
Duffham replied that he hoped so too, and thought he would.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Layne seems to be growing very old,&rdquo; went on Lady Chavasse.
&ldquo;She was as drowsy as she could be this afternoon, and seemed scarcely
to know me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old people are apt to be sleepy after dinner,&rdquo; returned the doctor.</p>

<p>And then there was a pause. Lady Chavasse (as Duffham&rsquo;s diary
expresses it) seemed to be particularly absent in manner, as if she were
thinking to herself, instead of talking to him. Because he had nothing
else to say, he asked after the health of Lady Rachel. That aroused
her at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is not strong. She is not strong. I am sure of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She does not seem to ail much, that I can see,&rdquo; returned Duffham,
who often had to hear this same thing said of Lady Rachel. &ldquo;She
never requires medical advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care: she is not strong. There are no children,&rdquo; continued
Lady Chavasse, dropping her voice to a whisper; and a kind of piteous,
imploring expression darkened her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four years married, going on for five, and no signs of any. No
signs of children, Mr. Duffham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, my lady,&rdquo; returned Duffham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody can help it. But it is an awful misfortune. It is beginning
to be a great trouble in my life. As the weeks and months and years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
pass on&mdash;the <em>years</em>, Mr. Duffham&mdash;and bring no hope, my very spirit
seems to fail. &lsquo;Hope deferred maketh the heart sick.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been the one great desire of my later years,&rdquo; continued Lady
Chavasse, too much in earnest to be reticent, &ldquo;and it does not come.
I wonder which is the worst to be borne; some weighty misfortune
that falls and crushes, or a longed-for boon that we watch and pray for
in vain? The want of it, the eager daily strain of disappointment, has
become to me worse than a nightmare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Little Arthur Layne, attended by Betsy, spent a day at the Grange
on his recovery, invited to meet the peacock. The ladies were very
kind to him: they could but admire his gentle manners, his fearless
bearing. Sir Geoffry played a game at ninepins with him on the lawn&mdash;which
set of ninepins had been his own when a child, and had been
lying by ever since. Betsy was told she might carry them home for
Master Layne: Sir Geoffry gave them to him.</p>

<p>After that, the intercourse dropped again, and they became strangers
as before. Except that Lady Chavasse would bow from her carriage if
she saw Mrs. or Miss Layne, and Sir Geoffry raise his hat. The little
boy had more notice: when they met him out, and were walking themselves,
they would, one and all, stop and speak to him.</p>

<p>So this episode of the accident seemed to fade into the past, as other
things had faded: and the time went on.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<h3>Part the Fourth.</h3>

<p>Autumn leaves were strewing the ground, autumn skies were overhead.
A ray of the sun came slanting into the library, passing right across the
face of Sir Geoffry Chavasse. The face had an older expression on it
than his thirty years would justify. It looked worn and weary, and the
bright hair, with its golden tinge, was less carefully arranged than it
used to be, as if exertion were becoming a burden, or that vanity no
longer troubled him; and his frame was almost painfully thin; and a
low hacking cough took him at intervals. It might have been thought
that Sir Geoffry was a little out of health, and wanted a change. Lady
Chavasse, his mother, had begun to admit a long-repressed doubt
whether any change would benefit him.</p>

<p>A common desk of stained walnut-wood was open on the table before
him: he had been reading over and putting straight some papers it
contained&mdash;notes and diaries, and so forth. Two or three of these he
tore across and threw into the fire. Out of a bit of tissue paper, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
took a curl of bright brown hair, recalling the day and hour when he
had surreptitiously cut it off, and refused to give it up again to its
blushing owner. Recalling also the happy feelings of that time&mdash;surreptitiously
still, as might be said, for what business had he with
them now? Holding the hair to his lips for a brief interval, he folded
it up again, and took out another bit of paper. This contained a lady&rsquo;s
ring of chased gold set with a beautiful and costly emerald. In those
bygone years he had bought the ring, thinking to give it in payment of
the stolen hair; but the young lady in her shyness had refused so
valuable a present. Sir Geoffry held the ring so that its brightness
glittered in the sun, and then wrapped it up again. Next he unfolded
a diary, kept at that past period, and for a short time afterwards: then
it was abruptly broken off, and had never since been written in. He
smiled to himself as he read a page here and there&mdash;but the smile was
full of sadness.</p>

<p>Lady Chavasse came into the room rather abruptly: Sir Geoffry shut
up the diary, and prepared to close and lock the desk. There was a
disturbed, restless, anxious look on my lady&rsquo;s face: there was a far
more anxious and bitter pain ever making havoc with her heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Geoffry! have you got out <em>that</em> old desk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Geoffry smiled as he carried it to its obscure place in a dark
corner of the library. When he was about twelve years old, and they
were passing through London, he went to the Lowther Arcade and
bought this desk, for which he had been saving up his shillings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe any lad ever had so valuable a prize as I thought I
had purchased in that desk, mother,&rdquo; was his laughing remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say it has a great deal of old rubbish in it,&rdquo; said Lady
Chavasse, slightingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much else&mdash;for all the good it can ever be. I was only
glancing over the rubbish&mdash;foolish mementoes of foolish days. These
days are weary; and I hardly know how to make their hours fly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Chavasse sighed at the words. He used to go shooting in the
autumn&mdash;fishing&mdash;hunting once in a way, in the later season: he had
not strength for these sports now.</p>

<p>Opening the desk he commonly used, a very handsome one that had
been Lady Chavasse&rsquo;s present to him, he took a small book from it and
put it into his breast-pocket. Lady Chavasse, watching all his movements,
as she had grown accustomed to do, saw and knew what the
book was&mdash;a Bible. Perhaps nothing had struck so much on my lady&rsquo;s
fears as the habit he had fallen into of often reading the Bible. She
had come upon him doing it in all kinds of odd places. Out amidst the
rocks at the seaside where they had recently been staying&mdash;and should
have stayed longer but that he grew tired and wanted to come home;
out in the seats of this garden, amidst the roses, or where the roses had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
him with this small Bible. He always slipped it away when she or any
one else approached: but the habit was casting on her spirit a very
ominous shadow. It seemed to show her that he knew he must be
drawing near to the world that the Bible tells of, and was making
ready for his journey. How her heart ached, ached always, Lady
Chavasse would not have liked to avow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Rachel?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On her sofa, upstairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Geoffry stirred the fire mechanically, his thoughts elsewhere&mdash;just
as he had stirred it in a memorable interview of the days gone by.
Unconsciously they had taken up the same position as on that unhappy
morning: he with his elbow on the mantelpiece, and his face partly
turned from his mother; she in the same chair, and on the same red
square of the Turkey carpet. The future had been before them then:
it lay in their own hands, so to say, to choose the path for good or for
ill. Sir Geoffry had pointed out which was the right one to take, and
said that it would bring them happiness. But my lady had negatived
it, and he could only bow to her decree. And so, the turning tide was
passed, not seized upon, and they had been sailing on a sea tolerably
smooth, but without depth in it or sunshine on it. What had the voyage
brought forth? Not much. And it seemed, so far as one was concerned,
nearly at an end now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancy Rachel cannot be well, mother,&rdquo; observed Sir Geoffry,
&ldquo;She would not lie down so much if she were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little inertness, Geoffry, nothing more. About Christmas?&rdquo;
continued Lady Chavasse. &ldquo;Shall you be well enough to go to the
Derrestons&rsquo;, do you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we had better let Christmas draw nearer before laying out
any plans for it,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s all very well: but I am going to write to Lady Derreston
to-day, and she will expect me to mention it. Shall you like to go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment&rsquo;s pause, and then he turned to her: his clear, dark-blue
eyes, ever kind and gentle, looking straight into hers; his voice low
and tender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not suppose I shall ever go away from the Grange again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned quite white. Was it coming so near as that? A kind
of terror took possession of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Geoffry! <em>Geoffry!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My darling mother, I will stay with you if I can; you know that.
But the fiat does not lie with you or with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Geoffry went behind her chair, and put his arms round her playfully,
kissing her with a strange tenderness of heart that he sought to
hide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be all well yet, mother. Don&rsquo;t let it trouble you before the
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>She could not make any rejoinder, could not speak, and quitted the
room to hide her emotion.</p>

<p>In the after-part of the day the surgeon, Duffham, bustled in. His
visit was later than usual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how are you, Sir Geoffry?&rdquo; he asked, as they sat alone, facing
each other between the table and the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much the same, Duffham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Sir Geoffry&mdash;you should rally both yourself and your
spirits. It&rsquo;s of no use <em>giving way</em> to illness. There&rsquo;s a certain listlessness
upon you; I&rsquo;ve seen it for some time. Shake it off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willingly&mdash;if you will give me the power to do so,&rdquo; was Sir
Geoffry&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;The listlessness you speak of proceeds from the fact
that my health and energies fail me. As to my spirits, there&rsquo;s nothing
the matter with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Duffham turned over with his fingers a glass paper-weight that
happened to lie on the table, as if he wanted to see the fishing-boats on
the sea that its landscape represented, and then he glanced at Sir
Geoffry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you wish to get well?&rdquo;&mdash;with a slight emphasis on the
&ldquo;wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most certainly I wish to get well. For my mother&rsquo;s sake&mdash;and of
course also for my wife&rsquo;s, as well as for my own. I don&rsquo;t expect to,
though, Duffham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s saying a great deal,&rdquo; retorted Duffham, pretending to
make a mockery of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not been strong for some time&mdash;as you may have seen,
perhaps: but since the beginning of May, when the intensely hot
weather came in, I have felt as&mdash;as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As what, Sir Geoffry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As though I should never live to see another May, hot or cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unreasonable heat has that effect on some people, Sir Geoffry.
Tries their nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not aware that it tries mine. My nerves are as sound as need
be. The insurance offices won&rsquo;t take my life at any price, Duffham,&rdquo;
he resumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you tried them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two of the best in London. When I began to grow somewhat
doubtful about myself in the spring, I thought of the future of those
near and dear to me, and would have insured my life for their benefit.
The doctors refused to certify. Since then I have felt nearly sure in
my own mind that what must be will be. And, day by day, I have
watched the shadow drawing nearer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor leaned forward and spoke a few earnest words of
encouragement, before departing. Sir Geoffry was only too willing to
receive them&mdash;in spite of the inward conviction that lay upon him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Lady Rachel Chavasse entered the library in the course of the afternoon.
She wore a sweeping silk, the colour of lilac, and gold ornaments.
Her face had not changed: with its classically-carved contour and its
pale coldness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Duffham think you are better, Geoffry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we were to try another change&mdash;Germany, or somewhere?&rdquo;
she calmly suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather be here than anywhere, Rachel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like you to get well, you know, Geoffry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like it too, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma has written to ask us to go into Somersetshire for Christmas,&rdquo;
continued Lady Rachel, putting her foot, encased in its black
satin shoe and white silk stocking, on the fender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay. My mother was talking about it just now. Well, we shall
see between now and Christmas, Rachel. Perhaps they can come to
us instead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Rachel turned her very light eyes upon her husband: eyes in
which there often sat a peevish expression. It was not discernible at
the present moment: they were coldly calm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you shall be quite well by Christmas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot speak with any certainty, Rachel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood a minute or two longer, and then walked round the room
before the shelves, in search of some entertaining book. It was quite
evident that the state of her husband did not bring real trouble to her
heart. Was the heart too naturally cold?&mdash;or was it that as yet no
suspicion of the seriousness of the case had penetrated to her? Something
of both, perhaps.</p>

<p>Selecting a book, she was leaving the library with it when Sir
Geoffry asked if she would not rather stay by the fire to read. But she
said she preferred to go to her sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you well, Rachel?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My back feels tired, always. I suppose we are something alike,
Geoffry&mdash;not over-strong,&rdquo; she concluded, with a smile.</p>

<p>That night Duffham made the annexed entry in his journal.</p>


<p>He does know the critical state he is in. Has known it, it seems,
for some time. I suspected he did. Sir Geoffry&rsquo;s one that you may
read as a book in his open candour. He would &ldquo;get well if he could,&rdquo;
he says, for his mother&rsquo;s sake. As of course he would, were the result
under his own control: a fine young fellow of the upper ten, with every
substantial good to make life pleasant, and no evil habits or thoughts
to draw him backward, would not close his eyes on this world without
a pang, and a struggle to remain a while longer in it.</p>

<p>I cannot do more for him than I am doing. All the faculty combined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
could not. Neither do I say, as he does, that he will not get better:
on the contrary, I think there&rsquo;s just a chance that he <em>will</em>: and I
honestly told him so. It&rsquo;s just a toss-up. He was always delicate until
he grew to manhood: then he seemed to become thoroughly healthy
and strong. Query: would this delicacy have come back again had his
life been made as happy as it might have been? My lady can debate
that point with herself in after-years: it may be that she&rsquo;ll have plenty
of time to do it in. Sir Geoffry&rsquo;s is one of those sensitive natures where
the mind seems almost wholly to influence the body; and that past
trouble was a sharp blow to him. Upright and honourable, he could
not well bear the remorse that fell upon him&mdash;it has been keenly felt,
ay, I verily believe, until this hour: another&rsquo;s life was blighted that his
might be aggrandized. <em>My own opinion is, that had he been allowed to
do as he wished, and make reparation, thereby securing his own happiness,
he might have thrown off the tendency to delicacy still and always; and
lived to be as old as his father, Sir Peter.</em> Should my lady ever speak
to me upon the subject, I shall tell her this. Geoffry Chavasse has
lived with a weight upon him. It was not so much that his own hopes
were gone and his love-dream wrecked, as that he had brought far
worse than this upon another. Yes; my lady may thank herself that
his life seems to have been wasted. Had there been children he might,
in a degree, have forgotten what went before, and the mind would no
longer have preyed upon the body. Has the finger of Heaven been in
this? My pen ought to have written &ldquo;<em>specially</em> in this:&rdquo; for that
Finger is in all things.</p>

<p>I hope he will get better. Yes, I <em>do</em>, in spite of a nasty doubt that
crops up in my mind as I say it. I love him as I did in the old days,
and respect him more. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui vivra verra</i>&mdash;to borrow a French phrase
from young Master Arthur over the way. And now I put up my diary
for the night.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Mrs. Layne was dead. Mary lived alone in her house now, with her
servants and Arthur.</p>

<p>Never a woman so respected as she; never a lady, high or low, so
revered and looked up to as Mary Layne. All the village would fly to
her on an emergency; and she had both counsel and help to give.
The poor idolized her. A noble, tender, good gentlewoman, with the
characteristic humility in her bearing that had been observable of late
years, and the gentle gravity on her thoughtful face. My lady, with
all her rank and her show and her condescension, had never been half
so much respected as this. The little boy&mdash;in knickerbockers now,
and nine years old&mdash;was a great favourite; he also got some honour
reflected on him through Colonel Layne. There had been a time of
trouble in India, and Major Layne had grandly distinguished himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and gained honour and promotion. The public papers proclaimed his
bravery and renown; and Arthur received his share of reflected glory.
As the boy passed on his pony, the blacksmith, Dobbs, would shoot
out from his forge to look after him, and say to the stranger whose
horse had cast a shoe, &ldquo;There goes the little son of the brave Colonel
Layne: maybe you&rsquo;ve heerd of his deeds over in Ingee.&rdquo; Perhaps the
blacksmith considered he had acquired a sort of right in Arthur, since
the pony&mdash;a sure-footed Welsh animal&mdash;was kept in the stable that
belonged to his forge, and was groomed by himself or son. Miss
Layne paid him for it; but, as the blacksmith said, it went again&rsquo; the
grain; he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been proud to do aught for her and the little gentleman
without pay.</p>

<p>And somehow, what with one thing and another, my lady grew to
think that if anything removed her from Chavasse Grange, Mary would
take her place as best and chiefest in Church Dykely, and she herself
would not be missed. But it was odd the thought should dawn upon
her. Previsions of coming events steal into the minds of a great many
of us; we know not whence they arise, and at first look on them only
as idle thoughts, never recognizing them for what they are&mdash;advance
shadows of the things to be.</p>

<p>One sunshiny afternoon, close upon winter, Arthur and Mr. Duffham
went out riding. Mary watched them start; the doctor on his old grey
horse (that had been her father&rsquo;s), and Arthur on his well-groomed
pony. The lad sat well; as brave-looking a little gentleman, with his
upright carriage, open face, and nice attire&mdash;for Mary was particular
there&mdash;as had ever gratified a fond aunt&rsquo;s eye, or a blacksmith&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>Close by the gates of Chavasse Grange, they met Sir Geoffry and
his mother strolling forth. Mr. Duffham&rsquo;s hopes had not been fulfilled.
Outwardly there was not much change in the baronet, certainly none
for the better; inwardly there was a great deal. He <em>knew</em> now how
very certain his fate was, and that it might not be delayed for any great
length of time; a few weeks, a few months: as God should will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady Rachel is not well,&rdquo; observed Sir Geoffry to the surgeon.
&ldquo;You must see her, Duffham. I suppose you can&rsquo;t come in now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can: I&rsquo;m in no hurry,&rdquo; was the doctor&rsquo;s answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I come too, and see the peacock, Sir Geoffry? I&rsquo;ll wait here,
though, if Mr. Duffham thinks I ought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course the boy was told that the peacock would take it as a slight
if he did not pay him a visit, and they all turned up the avenue.
Arthur got off his pony and led it, and talked with Lady Chavasse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you get off yet?&rdquo; asked Sir Geoffry, turning to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady Chavasse is walking,&rdquo; answered the boy, simply.</p>

<p>It spoke volumes for his innate sense of politeness. Sir Geoffry
remembered that <em>he</em> had possessed the same when a child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard what papa has done?&rdquo; asked Arthur, putting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
question generally. &ldquo;It has been in all the newspapers, and he is full
colonel now. Did you read it, Sir Geoffry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I read it, Arthur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Queen&rsquo;s going to thank papa when he comes to England,
and to make him Sir Richard. Everybody says so. Dobbs thinks
papa will be made general before he dies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dobbs was the blacksmith. They smiled at this. Not at the
possibility for Colonel Layne, but at Dobbs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, with it all, Aunt Mary does not want me to be a soldier!&rdquo;
went on the boy in rather an aggrieved tone. &ldquo;Richard&rsquo;s enough, she
says. Dick gets on well at King&rsquo;s College: he is to go to Woolwich
next. I don&rsquo;t see the peacock!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had neared the house, but the gay plumaged bird, for which
Arthur retained his full admiration, was nowhere in sight. Servants
came forward and led the horses away. Mr. Duffham went on to see
Lady Rachel: Arthur was taken into the garden-parlour by Sir Geoffry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you would like to be a soldier:&rdquo; he said, holding the boy
before him, and looking down at his bright, happy face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I should: very much. If papa says I&rsquo;m not to be&mdash;or mamma&mdash;or
Aunt Mary&mdash;if they should tell me &lsquo;No, no, you <em>shall not</em>,&rsquo; why, it
would be at an end, and I&rsquo;d try and like something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Arthur,&rdquo; said Sir Geoffry, in a low, earnest tone. &ldquo;What
you are to be, and what you are not to be, lie alike in the will of God.
He will direct you aright, no doubt, when the time of choice shall
come&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what Aunt Mary says,&rdquo; interrupted the lad. &ldquo;She
says&mdash;&mdash; There&rsquo;s the peacock!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had come round the corner, his tail trailing; the poor peahen
following humbly behind him, as usual. Arthur went outside the
window. The peacock had a most unsociable habit of stalking away
with a harsh scream if approached; Arthur knew this, and stayed
where he was, talking still with Sir Geoffry. When Lady Chavasse
entered, he was deep in a story of the musical box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a wicked boy went into Reuben Noah&rsquo;s, and broke his box
for the purpose. Aunt Mary is letting me get it mended for him with
some sixpences I had saved up. Reuben is very ill just now&mdash;in great
pain; and Aunt Mary has let me lend him mine&mdash;he says when he can
hear the music, his hip does not hurt him so much. You are not angry
with me for lending it, are you, Sir Geoffry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My boy, I am pleased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should Sir Geoffry be angry&mdash;what is it to him?&rdquo; cried
Lady Chavasse, amused with the chatter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Geoffry gave it to me,&rdquo; said Arthur, looking at her with wide-open
eyes, in which the great wonder that any one should be ignorant
of that fact was expressed. &ldquo;Reuben wishes he could get here to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the peacock: but he can&rsquo;t walk, you know. I painted a beautiful one
on paper and took it to him. Aunt Mary said it was not much like a
real peacock; it was too yellow. Reuben liked it, and hung it up on
his wall. Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the stately peacock, stepping past the window as if the world
belonged to him, suddenly threw wide his tail in an access of vanity.
The tail had not long been renewed, and was in full feather. Arthur&rsquo;s
face went into a radiant glow. Lady Chavasse, smiling at the childish
delight, produced some biscuit that the peacock was inordinately fond
of, and bade him go and feed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Geoffry,&rdquo; she exclaimed in the impulse of the moment, as the
boy vaulted away, &ldquo;if you only had such a son and heir as that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay. It might have been, mother. That child himself might have
been Sir Arthur after me, had you so willed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Been Sir Arthur after you!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Are you in a
dream, Geoffry? <em>That</em> child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have thought you did not know him, but I never felt quite sure.
He passes to the world for the son of Colonel Layne&mdash;as I trust he
may so pass always. Don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was so comical a thing, bringing up thoughts so astounding, and
the more especially because she had never had the remotest suspicion
of it, that Lady Chavasse simply stared at her son in silence. All in a
moment a fiery resentment rose up in her heart: she could not have
told at whom or what.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will never believe it, Geoffry. It <em>cannot be</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>is</em>, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was leaning against the embrasure of the window as he stood,
watching the boy in the distance throwing morsels of biscuit right into
the peacock&rsquo;s mouth, condescendingly held wide to receive them.
Lady Chavasse caught the strange sadness glistening in her son&rsquo;s eyes,
and somehow a portion of her hot anger died away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes: there was nothing to prevent it,&rdquo; sighed Sir Geoffry. &ldquo;Had
you allowed it, mother, the boy might have been born my lawful son,
my veritable heir. Other sons might have followed him: the probability
is, there would have been half-a-dozen of them feeding the
peacock now, instead of&mdash;of&mdash;I was going to say&mdash;of worse than none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Chavasse looked out at the boy with eager, devouring eyes:
and whether there was more of longing in their depths, or of haughty
anger, a spectator could not have told. In that same moment a vision,
so vivid as to be almost like reality, stole before her mental sight&mdash;of
the half-dozen brave boys crowding round the peacock, instead of only
that one on whose birth so cruel a blight had been cast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A noble heir he would have made us, mother; one of whom our
free land might have been proud,&rdquo; spoke Sir Geoffry, in a low tone of
yearning that was mixed with hopeless despair. &ldquo;He bears my name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Arthur. I would give my right hand&mdash;ay, and the left too&mdash;if he
could be Sir Arthur after me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arthur turned round. His cap was on the grass, his blue eyes were
shining.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is frightfully greedy and selfish, Lady Chavasse. He will not
let the peahen have a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A beautiful face,&rdquo; murmured Sir Geoffry. &ldquo;And a little like
what mine must have been at his age, I fancy. Sometimes I have
thought that you would see the likeness, and that it might impart its
clue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since when have you known him?&mdash;known this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since the day after the accident, when my horse threw him down.
Duffham dropped an unintentional word, and it enlightened me. Some
nights ago I dreamt that the little lad was my true heir,&rdquo; added Sir
Geoffry. &ldquo;I saw you kiss him in the dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have been letting your thoughts run on it very much,&rdquo;
retorted Lady Chavasse, rather sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are often running on it, mother: the regret for what might
have been and for what is, never seems to leave me,&rdquo; was his reply.
&ldquo;For some moments after I awoke from that dream I thought it was
reality: I believe I called out &lsquo;Arthur.&rsquo; Rachel started, and inquired
between sleeping and waking what the matter was. To find it was
only a dream&mdash;to remember that what <em>is</em> can never be changed or
redeemed in this world, was the worst pain of all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may have children yet,&rdquo; said Lady Chavasse, after a pause.
&ldquo;It is not impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose not impossible,&rdquo; was the hesitating rejoinder.
&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t think it. Say it out, Geoffry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think it. My darling mother, don&rsquo;t you see how it is with
me?&rdquo; he added, in an impulse of emotion&mdash;&ldquo;that I am not to live.
A very short time now, and I shall be lying with my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A piteous cry broke from her. It had to be suppressed. The
ungrateful peacock, seeing no more dainty biscuit in store, had fluttered
off with a scream, putting his tail down into the smallest possible
compass; and Arthur came running back to the room. Mr. Duffham
next appeared; his face grave, his account of Lady Rachel evasive.
He suspected some latent disease of the spine, but did not wish to say
so just yet.</p>

<p>The horse and pony were brought round. Arthur and the doctor
mounted; Arthur turning round to lift his cap to Lady Chavasse and
Sir Geoffry as he rode away. A noble boy in all his actions; sitting
his pony like the young chieftain he ought to have been but for my
lady&rsquo;s adverse will.</p>

<p>But Mr. Duffham was by no means prepared for an inroad on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
privacy made that evening by my lady. She surprised him in his
shabbiest parlour, when he was taking his tea: the old tin teapot on
the Japan tray, and the bread-and-butter plate cracked across. Zuby
Noah, Duffham&rsquo;s factotum, was of a saving turn, and never would
bring in the best things except on Sundays. He had a battle with
her over it sometimes, but it did no good. Duffham thought Lady
Chavasse had come to hear about Lady Rachel, but he was mistaken.</p>

<p>She began with a despairing cry, by way of introduction to the
interview; Zuby might have heard it as she went along the kitchen
passage, but for her clanking pattens. The man-servant was out that
evening, and Zuby was in waiting. Duffham, standing on the old
hearthrug, found his arm seized by Lady Chavasse. He had never
seen her in agitation like this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it to be so really? Mr. Duffham, can <em>nothing</em> be done? Is my
son to die before my very eyes, and not be saved?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, pray, Lady Chavasse!&rdquo; cried Duffham, trying to hand
her into the chair that had the best-looking cushion on it, and wishing
he had been in the other room and had not slipped on his worn, old
pepper-and-salt coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ought not to die&mdash;to die and leave no children!&rdquo; she went on,
as if she were a lunatic. &ldquo;If there were but one little son&mdash;but one&mdash;to
be the heir! <em>Can&rsquo;t</em> you keep him in life? there may be children
yet, if he only lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes were looking wildly into his; her fingers entwined themselves
about the old grey cuffs as lovingly as though they were of silk
velvet. No: neither Duffham nor any one else had ever seen her
like this. It was as though she thought it lay with Duffham to keep
Sir Geoffry in life and to endow Chavasse Grange with heirs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady Chavasse, I am not in the place of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care for my trouble? Don&rsquo;t you <em>care</em> for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do care. I wish I could cure Sir Geoffry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down sat my lady in front of the fire, in dire tribulation. By the
way she stared at it, Duffham thought she must see in it a vision of
the future.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall have to quit the Grange, you know, if he should die:
I and Lady Rachel. Better that I quitted it in my young life; that
I had never had a male child to keep me in it. I thought that would
have been a hardship: but oh, it would have been nothing to this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall take a cup of tea, Lady Chavasse&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t mind its
being poured out of this homely tea-pot,&rdquo; said Duffham. &ldquo;Confound
that Zuby!&rdquo; he cried, under his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will take the tea&mdash;put nothing in it. My lips and throat
are dry with fever and pain. I wish I could die instead of Geoffry!
I wish he could have left a little child behind to bless me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Duffham, standing up whilst she took the tea, thought it was well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
that these trials of awful pain did not fall often in a lifetime, or they
would wear out alike the frame and the spirit. She grew calm again.
As if ashamed of the agitation betrayed, her manner gradually took
a sort of hard composure, her face a defiant expression. She turned it
on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, Mr. Duffham! It has been well done of you, to unite with Sir
Geoffry in deceiving me! That child over the way has never been
Colonel Layne&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then she went on in a style that put Duffham&rsquo;s back up. It
was not his place to tell her, he answered. At the same time he had
had no motive to keep it from her, and if she had ever put the question
to him, he should readily have answered it. Unsolicited, unspoken to,
of course he had held his peace. As to uniting with Sir Geoffry to
deceive her, she deceived herself if she thought anything of the kind.
Since the first moment they had spoken together, when the fact had
become known to Sir Geoffry, never a syllable relating to it had been
mentioned between them. And then, after digesting this for a few
minutes in silence, she went back to Sir Geoffry&rsquo;s illness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is just as though a blight had fallen on him,&rdquo; she piteously exclaimed,
lifting her hand and letting it drop again. &ldquo;A blight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Lady Chavasse, I suppose something of the kind did fall
upon him,&rdquo; was Duffham&rsquo;s answer.</p>

<p>And <em>that</em> displeased her. She turned her offended face to the doctor,
and inquired what he meant by saying it.</p>

<p>So Duffham set himself to speak out. He had said he would, if
ever the opportunity came. Reverting to what had happened some
nine or more years ago, he told her that in his opinion Sir Geoffry had
never recovered it: that the trouble had so fixed itself upon him as to
have worked insensibly upon his bodily health.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Self-reproach and disappointment were combined, Lady Chavasse;
for there&rsquo;s no doubt that the young lady was very dear to him,&rdquo; concluded
Duffham. &ldquo;And there are some natures that cannot pick up
again after such a blow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was staring at Duffham with open eyes, not understanding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not mean to say that&mdash;that the disappointment about <em>her</em>
has killed Sir Geoffry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My goodness, no!&rdquo; cried Duffham, nearly laughing. &ldquo;Men are
made of tougher stuff than to die of the thing called love, Lady
Chavasse. What is it Shakespeare says? &lsquo;Men have died, and worms
have eaten them, but not for love.&rsquo; There is no question but that Sir
Geoffry has always had an inherent tendency to delicacy of constitution,&rdquo;
he continued more seriously: &ldquo;my partner Layne told me so.
It was warded off for a time, and he grew into a strong, hearty man:
it might perhaps have been warded off for good. But the blight&mdash;as
you aptly express it, Lady Chavasse&mdash;came: and perhaps since then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the spirit has not been able to maintain its own proper struggle for
existence&mdash;in which lies a great deal, mind you; and now that the
original weakness has shown itself again, he cannot shake it off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;according to that&mdash;he <em>is</em> dying of the blight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;in a sense, yes. If you like to put it so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her lips grew white. There rose before her mind that one hour of
bitter agony in her lifetime and her son&rsquo;s, when he had clasped his
pleading hands on hers, and told her in a voice hoarse with its bitter
pain and emotion that if she decided against him he could never know
happiness again in this world: that to part from one to whom he was
bound by sweet endearment, by every tie that ought to bind man to
woman, would be like parting with life. Entrenched in her pride, she
had turned a deaf ear, and rejected his prayer: and now there had
come of it what had come. Yes, as Lady Chavasse sat there, she had
the satisfaction of knowing that the work was hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A warmer climate?&mdash;would it restore him?&rdquo; she exclaimed, turning
her hot eyes on Mr. Duffham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had it been likely to do so, Lady Chavasse, I should have sent him
to one long ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gathered her mantle of purple velvet about her as she rose up,
and went out of the room in silence, giving Duffham her hand in token
of friendship.</p>

<p>Duffham opened the front-door, and was confronted by a tall footman&mdash;with
a gold-headed cane and big white silk calves&mdash;who had
been waiting in the air for his lady. She took the way to the Grange;
the man and his protecting cane stepping grandly after her.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>&ldquo;Sir Geoffry Chavasse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Buried in her own reflections by the drawing-room fire, in the coming
dusk of the winter&rsquo;s evening, Miss Layne thought her ears must have
deceived her. But no. It was Sir Geoffry who advanced as the
servant made the announcement; and she rose to meet him. Strangely
her heart fluttered: but she had been learning a lesson in calmness for
many years; he had too, perhaps; and they shook hands quietly as
other people do. Sir Geoffry threw back his overcoat from his wasted
form as he sat down.</p>

<p>Wasted more than ever now. Some weeks have gone on since my
lady&rsquo;s impromptu visit to Mr. Duffham&rsquo;s tea-table; winter is merging
into spring; and the most sanguine could no longer indulge hope for
Sir Geoffry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have heard how it is with me?&rdquo; he began, looking at Mary,
after recovering his short breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she faintly answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not die without seeing you, Mary, and speaking a word of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
farewell. It was in my mind to ask you to come to the Grange for
half-an-hour&rsquo;s interview; but I scarcely saw how to accomplish it: it
might have raised some speculation. So as the day has been fine and
mild, I came to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have come earlier,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;It is getting late
and cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did come out earlier. But I have been with Duffham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moving his chair a little nearer to hers, he spoke to her long and
earnestly. In all that was said there seemed to be a solemn meaning&mdash;as
is often the case when the speaker is drawing to the confines of this
world and about to enter on the next. He referred a little to the past,
and there was some mutual explanation. But it seemed to be of the
future that Sir Geoffry had come chiefly to speak&mdash;the future of Baby
Arthur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will take care of him, Mary?&mdash;of his best interests?&rdquo; And
the tears came into Mary Layne&rsquo;s eyes at the words. He could not
really think it necessary to ask it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. To the very utmost of my power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not able to leave him anything. You know how things are
with us at the Grange. My wish would have been good&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not necessary,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;All I have will be his, Sir
Geoffry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Sir</em> Geoffry! Need you keep up that farce, Mary, in this our last
hour? He seems to wish to be a soldier: and I cannot think but that
the profession will be as good for him as any other, provided you can
<em>like</em> it for him. You will see when the time comes: all that lies in the
future. Our lives have been blighted, Mary: and I pray God daily
and hourly that, being so, it may have served to expiate the sin&mdash;my
sin, my love, it was never yours&mdash;and that no shame may fall on him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it will not,&rdquo; she softly said, the painful tears dropping fast.
&ldquo;He will always be regarded as Colonel Layne&rsquo;s son: the very few
who know otherwise&mdash;Mr. Duffham, Colonel and Mrs. Layne, and
Lady Chavasse now&mdash;will all be true to the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay. I believe it too. I think the boy may have a bright and
honourable career before him: as much so perhaps as though he had
been born my heir. I think the regret that he was not&mdash;when he so
easily might have been&mdash;has latterly helped to wear me out, Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you could have lived, Geoffry!&rdquo; she cried from between her
blinding tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have wished it also,&rdquo; he answered, his tone full of pain. &ldquo;But it
was not to be. When the days shall come that my mother is alone,
except for Lady Rachel, and grieving for me, I want you to promise
that you will sometimes see her and give her consolation. Something
tells me that you can do this, Mary, that she will take it from you&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
I know that she will need it sadly. Be kind to her when I am
gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I promise it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the bravest of us all, Mary. And yet upon you has lain the
greatest suffering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the suffering that has made me brave,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Oh,
Geoffry, I am getting to realize the truth that it is better to have too
much of suffering in this world than too little. It is a truth hard to
learn: but once learnt, it brings happiness in enduring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Geoffry nodded assent. He had learnt somewhat of it also&mdash;too late.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have begun a confidential letter to Colonel Layne, Mary, and
shall post it before I die. To thank him for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words were drowned in a gleeful commotion&mdash;caused by the
entrance of Arthur. The boy came dashing in from his afternoon&rsquo;s
study with the curate, some books under his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not been good, Aunt Mary. He said I gave him no end of
trouble; and I&rsquo;m afraid I did: but, you see, I bought the marbles
going along, instead of in coming back, as you told me, and&mdash;&mdash; Who&rsquo;s
that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In letting his books fall on a side-table, he had caught sight of the
stranger&mdash;then standing up. The fire had burnt low, and just for the
moment even the young eyes did not recognize Sir Geoffry Chavasse.
Mary stirred the fire into a blaze, and drew the crimson curtains before
the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you come for?&rdquo; asked the little lad, as Sir Geoffry took
his hand. &ldquo;Are you any better, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall never be better in this world, Arthur. And so you gave
your tutor trouble this afternoon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I am very sorry: I told him so. It was all through the
marbles. I couldn&rsquo;t keep my hands out of my pockets. Just look
what beauties they are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Out came a handful of &ldquo;beauties&rdquo; of many colours. But Mary, who
was standing by the mantelpiece, her face turned away, bade him put
them up again. Arthur began to feel that there was some kind of
hush upon the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been talking to Miss Layne about your future&mdash;for, do you
know, Arthur, you are a favourite of mine,&rdquo; said Sir Geoffry. &ldquo;Ever
since the time when my horse knocked you down&mdash;and might have
killed you&mdash;I have taken a very warm interest in your welfare. I
have often wished that you&mdash;that you&rdquo;&mdash;he seemed to hesitate in some
emotion&mdash;&ldquo;were my own little son and heir to succeed me; but of
course that cannot be. I don&rsquo;t know what profession you will choose,
or may be chosen for you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to be a soldier,&rdquo; interrupted Arthur, lifting his
sparkling eyes to Sir Geoffry&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Your ideas may change before the time for choosing shall come.
But a soldier may be as brave a servant of God as of his queen: should
you ever become a soldier, will you remember this truth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Arthur, in a whisper, for the grave tones and manner
impressed him with some awe.</p>

<p>Sir Geoffry was sitting down and holding Arthur before him. To
the latter&rsquo;s intense surprise, he saw two tears standing on the wasted
cheeks. It made him feel a sort of discomfort, and he began, as a
relief, to play with the chain and seal that hung on the baronet&rsquo;s
waistcoat. A transparent seal, with a plain device on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should you like to have them when I am gone, Arthur&mdash;and wear
them in remembrance of me when you are old enough? I think it
must be so: no one can have a better right to them than my little
friend who once nearly lost his arm by my carelessness. I will see
about it. But I have a better present than that&mdash;which I will give
you now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking from his pocket the small Bible that had been his companion
for some months, he put it into Arthur&rsquo;s hands, telling him that he had
written his name in it. And the child, turning hastily to the fly-leaf,
saw it there: &ldquo;Arthur Layne. From G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;C.&rdquo; Lower down were
the words: &ldquo;Come unto Me all ye that labour and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jesus said that!&rdquo; cried the boy, simply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jesus Christ. My Saviour and yours&mdash;for I am sure you will let
Him be yours. Do not part with this Book, Arthur. Use it always:
I have marked many passages in it. Should it be your fate ever to
encamp on the battle-field, let the Book be with you: your guide and
friend. In time you will get to love it better than any book that is to
be had in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child had a tender heart, and began to cry a little. Sir Geoffry
drew him nearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have prayed to God to bless you, Arthur. But you know, my
child, He will only give His best blessing to those who seek it, who
love and serve Him. Whatsoever may be your lot in life, strive to do
your duty in it, as before God; loving Him, loving and serving your
fellow-creatures; trusting ever to Christ&rsquo;s atonement. These are my
last solemn words to you. Do you always remember them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His voice faltered a little, and Arthur began to sob. &ldquo;Oh, Sir
Geoffry, must you die?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Geoffry seemed to be breathing fast, as though agitation were
becoming too much for him. He bent his head and kissed the boy&rsquo;s
face fervently: his brow, his cheeks, his lips, his eyelids&mdash;there was not
a spot that Sir Geoffry did not leave a kiss upon. It quite seemed as
though his heart had been yearning for those kisses, and as though he
could not take enough of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Arthur, you must do a little errand for me. Go over to
Mr. Duffham, and tell him I am coming. Leave the Bible on the
table here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arthur went out of the house with less noise than he had entered it.
Sir Geoffry rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is our turn to part now, Mary. I must be gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her sweet face was almost distorted with the efforts she had been
making to keep down emotion before the child. She burst into tears,
as her hand met Sir Geoffry&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless you! God bless you always, my darling!&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;Take my thanks, once for all, for the manner in which you have met
the past; there is not another woman living who would have done and
borne as you have. This is no doubt our last meeting on earth, Mary;
but in eternity we shall be together for ever. God bless you, and love
you, and keep you always!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A lingering hand-pressure, a steady look into each other&rsquo;s eyes,
reading the present anguish there, reading also the future trust, and
then their lips met&mdash;surely there was no wrong in it!&mdash;and a farewell
kiss of pain was taken. Sir Geoffry went out, buttoning his overcoat
across his chest.</p>

<p>A fly was waiting before Mr. Duffham&rsquo;s house; the surgeon and
Arthur were standing by it on the pavement. Sir Geoffry got inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Sir Geoffry!&rdquo; cried the little lad, as Mr. Duffham,
saying he should be at the Grange in the morning, was about to close
the door. &ldquo;I shall write and tell papa how good you&rsquo;ve been, to give
me your own Bible. I can write small-hand now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And fine small-hand it is!&rdquo; put in old Duffham in disparagement.</p>

<p>Sir Geoffry laid his hand gently on Arthur&rsquo;s head, and kept it there
for a minute. His lips were moving, but he said nothing aloud.
Arthur thought he had not been heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Sir Geoffry,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, my child.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Sir Geoffry lay back in an easy-chair in front of the fire in his library.
The end was near at hand now, but he was bearing up quite well to
the last. Lady Chavasse, worn almost to a shadow with grief and uncertainty&mdash;for
there were times yet when she actually entertained a
sort of hope&mdash;sat away in the shade; her eyes watching every change
in his countenance, her heart feeling ever its bitter repentance and
despair.</p>

<p>Repentance? Yes, and plenty of it. For she saw too surely what
might have been and what was&mdash;and knew that it was herself, herself only,
who had worked out this state of things. Her self-reproach was terrible;
her days and nights were one long dream of agony. Lady Rachel was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
not with them very much. She lay down more than ever in her own
room; and Lady Chavasse had begun to learn that this almost continuous
lying was not caused by inert idleness, but of necessity. The
Grange was a sad homestead now.</p>

<p>The blaze from the fire flickered on Sir Geoffry&rsquo;s wasted face. <em>Hers</em>
was kept in the shadow, or it might have betrayed the bitterness of her
aching heart. He had been speaking of things that touched her conscience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was a sin, mother. But it might have been repaired; and,
if it had been, I believe God would have blessed us all. As it is&mdash;well,
we did not repair it, you and I; and so&mdash;and so, as I take it, there has
not been much of real blessing given to us here; certainly not of heartfelt
comfort. I seem to see all things clearly now&mdash;if it be not wrong
to say it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Chavasse saw them too&mdash;though perhaps not exactly in the
way he meant. Never was the vision, of what might have been, more
vividly before her than now as he spoke. She saw him, a hale happy
man; his wife Mary, their children, a goodly flock, all at the Grange,
and herself first amongst them, reigning paramount, <em>rejoicing</em> in her
good and dutiful daughter-in-law. Oh, what a contrast between that
vision and reality! A repressed groan escaped her lips; she coughed
to smother it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Geoffry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not have suppressed my last letter to Mary&mdash;the letter
of explanation I wrote when I quitted her and the Grange. You might
have been sure of me&mdash;that I would be true to my word to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No answer. There was a great deal that she would not suppress,
besides the letter, if the time had to come over again. The log
sparkled and crackled and threw its jets of flame upwards; but no
other noise disturbed the room&rsquo;s stillness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Geoffry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like the child, little Arthur, to have my watch and its
appendages. Have you any objection?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be looked upon, you know, as a token of remembrance to
the little fellow who had so sharp an illness through my horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;I have two desks, you know. The old one of common
stained wood I wish sent to Miss Layne, locked as it is. The key I
will enclose in a note. Let them be sent to her when I am dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shall be done, Geoffry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much in the desk. Just a few odds and ends of papers;
mementoes of the short period when I was happy&mdash;though I ought not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
to have been. Nothing of value; except a ring that I bought for her
at Worcester at the time, and which she would not take.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise it, Geoffry. I will do all you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you. You have ever been my loving friend, mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ever</em>, Geoffry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;you did for the best there, mother; though it was a mistake.
You acted for what you thought my welfare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you not like to see her, Geoffry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen her and bidden her farewell. It was the afternoon I
went to Duffham&rsquo;s and you said that I stayed out too late. And now
I think I&rsquo;ll lie down on the sofa, and get, if I can, a bit of sleep; I feel
tired. To-morrow I will talk about you and Rachel&mdash;and what will be
best for you both. I wish to my heart, for your sake and hers, that
Rachel had borne a son; I am thinking of you both daily, and of what
you will do when I am gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall never know pleasure in life again, Geoffry,&rdquo; she cried, with
a heartbroken sob. &ldquo;Life for me will be, henceforth, one of mortification
and misery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it will not last for ever. Oh, mother! how merciful God is!&mdash;to
give us the blessed hope of an eternal life of perfect happiness, after
all the mistakes and tribulations and disappointments of this! My
darling mother! we shall all be there in sweet companionship for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>They buried Sir Geoffry Chavasse by the side of his father&mdash;and
any one who likes to go there may see his tomb against the graveyard
wall of Church Dykely. My Lady Chavasse arranged the funeral. The
Earl of Derreston and a Major Chavasse were chief mourners, with
other grand people. Duffham&rsquo;s diary gives the particulars, but there
is no space here to record them. Duffham was bidden to it; and
brought Arthur Layne in his hand to the Grange, in obedience to a
private word of my lady&rsquo;s&mdash;for she knew the dead, if he could look out
of his coffin, would like to see Arthur following. So the procession
started, a long line; the village gazing in admiration as it passed; and
Dobbs the blacksmith felt as proud as ever was the Grange peacock,
when he saw Colonel Layne&rsquo;s little son in a coach, amidst the gentlefolks.
&rsquo;Twere out of respect to the colonel&rsquo;s bravery, you might be
sure, he told a select audience: and p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps a bit because o&rsquo; that back
accident to the child hisself. And so, amidst pomps, and coaches, and
comments, Geoffry Chavasse was left in his last home.</p>


<h4>[<i>Final matters extracted from Duffham&rsquo;s Diary.</i>]</h4>

<p>It is eighteen months now since Sir Geoffry died; and strange
changes have taken place. The world is always witnessing such: you
go up, and I go down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Admiral Chavasse came home and took possession of the Grange.
My lady had previously quitted it. She did not quit Church Dykely.
It seemed indifferent to her where she settled down; and Lady Rachel
Chavasse had become used to my attendance, and wished to stay.
There was a small white villa to let on this side of the Grange, and
they took it. Lady Rachel lies down more than ever; when she goes
out it is in a Bath-chair. Old John Noah draws it. The spinal complaint
is confirmed. I can do her no good; but I go in once or twice a
week, and have a gossip. She is very fractious: and what with one
thing and another, my Lady Chavasse has a trying life of it. They
keep three servants only; no carriage&mdash;except the Bath-chair. What
a change! what a change!</p>

<p>If ever there was a disappointed woman in this world, one who feels
the humiliation of her changed position keenly, whose whole life is a
long living repentance, it is Lady Chavasse. The picture of what
might have been is ever in her mind; the reality of what is, lies around
her. To judge by human fallibility, she has a long existence before
her: not quite fifty yet, and her health rude: but in spirit she is a
bowed, broken-down woman.</p>

<p>The Grange is let. Sir Parker Chavasse could not reconcile himself
to living in a rural district, and went back to his ship. At first he shut
the Grange up; now he has let it for a term to Mr. and Mrs. McAlpin,
formerly of Calcutta. They live there with their children; in as good
a style as ever the Chavasses did. Allan McAlpin has given up
business, and spends his large fortune like the gentleman he is. She is
Mary Layne&rsquo;s sister: a dainty and rather haughty woman. My lady
looks out surreptitiously from the corner of her window as Mrs.
McAlpin&rsquo;s carriage bowls along the road beyond the field. Colonel
Layne&rsquo;s wife is also here just now, on a visit at the Grange; her
husband, Sir Richard Layne, K.C.B., has returned to his duties in
India. The whole county calls upon them and seems proud to do it,
forgetting perhaps that they were only the daughters of my predecessor,
Layne the apothecary. Yes! there are strange ups and downs in this
world: and Mary Layne, so despised once, might not now be thought,
even by my lady, so very unequal to Sir Geoffry Chavasse.</p>

<p><em>She</em> does not go in for grandeur. But the village would like to lay
its hands under her feet. Never was there so good, so unselfish, so
sweet and humble-minded a woman as Mary. In a temporary indisposition
that attacked her a few weeks ago, Mr. Dobbs, struck with consternation,
gave, it as his opinion that Church Dykely &ldquo;could afford to
lose the whole biling of &rsquo;em, better than her.&rdquo; Lady Chavasse has
seen her merit at last; and Mary&rsquo;s frequent presence in their house
seems to bring light to the two lonely women. Arthur goes there too;
my lady loves him, curious though the fact may sound. An incident
occurred the other evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Layne and Arthur were at tea there, when I happened to go
in with some medicine. Mary had her work out, and sat talking in a
low voice to Lady Rachel on her sofa; Lady Chavasse was watching
Arthur, playing on the grass-plat. My lady rose up with a sudden
cry:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care of the wasp, Sir Arthur! Sir Arthur!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I saw what painful reverie she had been lost in&mdash;the vision of that
which might have been. It is apt to steal on her at sunset. Becoming
conscious of the slip, she flushed slightly, and turned it off. Lady
Rachel laughed; she thought it a good joke. Mary was more silent
than usual that night, as I walked home by her and Arthur&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>Here ends the history. Mary Layne lives on in her home, training
Arthur, helping the sick and suffering, keeping her face steadily turned
to another world. Never a one is there amidst us so respected as that
good, grave lady, who blighted her life in early womanhood, and who
carries its trace on her sad, sweet countenance, and its never-ceasing
shame on her sorrowing heart.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all at last. You must be glad of it. Old Duffham shall not
lead me blindfold into one of his spun-out histories again. The trouble
I&rsquo;ve had to cut it down! What with the diaries and letters, it was
twice as long.</p>

<p>And he called it a tale of sin. I, Johnny Ludlow, think it is more
like a tale of suffering.</p>

<h2><span class="f9">X.</span><br />

A DAY OF PLEASURE.</h2>


<p>We all liked Captain Sanker; a post-captain in the navy, ages since
on half-pay; who came into Worcestershire, and brought a letter of
introduction to the Squire. He was about a seventeenth cousin of the
Sankers of Wales, and a twenty-seventh of Mrs. Todhetley. The
captain and his wife and family, six children, had lived in Ireland and
the Channel Islands, and other cheap localities, making both ends of
their income meet as well as they could&mdash;and nobody need be told
how poor is the half-pay of naval officers, and what a fight and a
struggle it is to rub along. At last, through the death of a relative of
Mrs. Sanker, they dropped into quite a fortune, and came over to settle
at Worcester.</p>

<p>A Dr. Teal, who had also recently come to Worcester, and was an
old friend of Captain Sanker, proposed it to them. He wrote a flaming
account of the pretty place that Worcester was, of the loveliness of the
surrounding country; and of the great advantage the college school
would be to the young Sankers, in giving them a free education if they
could be got into it. The prospect of a free education for his boys
took with the captain, and he lost no time in removing to Worcester,
the Welsh Sankers giving him an introduction to us. We grew pretty
intimate: calling on them when we went to Worcester for a day, and
having them over to spend days with us.</p>

<p>All the young Sankers were got into the college school by degrees,
and became four of the forty king&rsquo;s scholars. At that time&mdash;it is long
past now&mdash;the school was not thought much of, for the boys were
taught little but the classics, so entrance was easy: Latin, Greek, bad
writing, and the first rule in arithmetic: there it ended. Captain
Sanker thought the education first-rate, and had them all enrolled:
Frederick, Daniel, King, and Toby. As to Toby, I fancy his real
name was Alfred, but I never heard him called by it.</p>

<p>They had been in Worcester between one and two years, when Tod
and I went over to them on a visit. The captain had come to spend
a summer&rsquo;s day at Crabb Cot, and in his jolly, open-hearted fashion
insisted on taking us two back with him. He was a short, stout man,
with grey hair, and merry bright blue eyes all alight with smiles. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
college school would be breaking up for its long holidays in a week or
so, and it would have been better for us to have gone then; but the
captain always did things on impulse, and had no more forethought
than young Toby. The holidays were taken late that year, and would
be very long, because the college hall, which was the schoolroom,
would be wanted for the music-meeting in September.</p>

<p>The Sankers&rsquo; was a funny household, and we pitched down amongst
them without ceremony on either side. The house was at the corner
of an open road, not very far from the cathedral. It was a commodious
house as to size; but all the rooms were in an everlasting litter, so that
you could never find a chair to sit down on. The captain was good-humoured
always, going in and out a hundred times a day. There
seemed to be no fixed hour for meals, and sometimes no meals to eat:
Mrs. Sanker would forget to order them. She was a little lady, who
went about as if she were dreaming, in a white petticoat and loose buff
jacket; or else she&rsquo;d be sitting aloft in the turret, darning stockings
and saying poetry. She was the least excitable person I ever knew;
all events, good and bad, she took as a matter of course: had the
house caught fire she would have looked on quietly&mdash;as Nero did when
Rome was burning. Why they called the room the turret did not
appear. It had a great high beam running through it on the floor:
and Mrs. Sanker would sit on that, reading poetry to us or telling her
dreams, her light hair all down.</p>

<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock the boys had to be in school. Being summer
weather, that was no hardship. At nine they came in again with a
rush, wild for breakfast. If Mrs. Sanker was not down to give it them,
the four boys would begin and eat up the piles of bread-and-butter;
upon which Hetta Sanker would call them tigers, and go to the
kitchen to tell the maids to cut more. Which was the cook of the
two servants and which the housemaid, they did not themselves seem
to know: both did the work indiscriminately. Breakfast over, the
boys went out again, Tod and I with them. At ten they must be
in school. At one they came home to dinner; it might be ready, or
it might not: if not, they&rsquo;d go in and polish off anything cold that
might be in the larder. It didn&rsquo;t seem to spoil their dinners. Afternoon
school again until four o&rsquo;clock; and then at liberty for good.
Tea was at any time; a scrambling sort of meal that stayed on the
table for hours, and was taken just as we chanced to go in for it.
Jam and boiled eggs would be on the table, with the loaf and butter
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</i>. Sometimes toast and dripping, and there used to be a
scuffle for that. As to dinner, when Mrs. Sanker forgot it, the servants
would bring in a big dish of poached eggs, and we made it up with
bread-and-cheese. Or Dan or Toby would be sent tearing off to High
Street for a lot of penny pork-pies and apple-tarts. At night we had
prayers, which the captain read.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Now I dare say that to people accustomed to a domestic life like
clock-work, this would have been unbearable. I thought it delightful;
as did Tod. It was like a perpetual picnic. But it was from one of
these dinnerless episodes we found out that Captain Sanker had a
temper. Generally speaking, he took disasters with equanimity.</p>

<p>It was on a Thursday. We were to have had four ducks for dinner,
which the captain had bought at market the day before. Fine ducks
that he was proud of: he carried them home himself, and brought them
into the parlour to show us. On this day, Thursday, Tod and I had
been into the Town Hall in the morning, listening to a trial before the
magistrates&mdash;some fellow who had stolen his neighbour&rsquo;s clothes-props
and cut them up for firewood. We reached home just as the boys and
their books did, as hungry as they were. There was no cloth laid, and
Fred shouted out for Biddy, asking whether we were to dine to-day or
to-morrow. Biddy heard, and came rushing in with the cloth and
knife-tray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s for dinner besides the four ducks?&rdquo; asked Dan. &ldquo;Any
pudding? Have you put plenty of stuffing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed then, and I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much for dinner,&rdquo; replied
Biddy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in the turret with the missis all the morning,
helping to stuff a pillow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laid the cloth, and Mrs. Sanker came mooning down in the short
white petticoat and buff jacket, darning a sock of Dan&rsquo;s. The dreadful
truth came out&mdash;busy over beds and pillows, nobody had thought of
dinner, and the ducks were hanging in the larder, uncooked. Before
speechless tongues could find words, Captain Sanker came in, bringing
his friend Dr. Teal to taste the ducks. All the Teals were as intimate
at the house as we were. Years before, when the captain was a middy,
Dr. Teal had been assistant-surgeon on the same ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve a cold dinner at Teal&rsquo;s to-day,&rdquo; said the captain to his wife,
as she was shaking hands with the doctor, &ldquo;so he has come to share
ours. Fine ducks they are, Teal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the news had to be told. The ducks were not cooked: dinner
altogether had been forgotten.</p>

<p>I saw Captain Sanker&rsquo;s face turn white&mdash;quite white; but he did not
say a word. Dr. Teal&mdash;a scientific Scotchman, who walked with his
nose in the air and his spectacles turned to the skies, as if always looking
for a lunar rainbow&mdash;made the best of it. Laughing, he said he
would come in another day, and went out.</p>

<p>Then it began. Captain Sanker gave vent to passion in a way that
startled me, and made Tod stare. I don&rsquo;t believe he knew for a few
moments what he was doing or saying. Nora, the other servant&mdash;both
girls had come with them from Ireland, and were as thoughtless as their
mistress&mdash;came in with a dish of some hastily concocted pudding: a
sort of batter. The captain, who still had his stick in his hand, lifted it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and spattered the pudding all about the cloth. Then he stamped out
of the house with a bang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, dears,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sanker, not at all moved, as she began
to collect the pudding with a spoon. &ldquo;Bring in the cheese, Nora, and
do some eggs. Here&rsquo;s a corner seat for you, Johnny; can you squeeze
in? The captain will have his dinner with the Teals, no doubt. He
has been tasting the doctor&rsquo;s port wine, I think; or he wouldn&rsquo;t have
been so put up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And somehow we gathered, then or later, that the captain was easy
as an old glove at all times and over all crosses, unless he was a little
&ldquo;put up&rdquo; by artificial help. He told us himself one day (not, of course,
alluding to anything of this sort) that he had had naturally an awful
temper, would go into passions of absolute madness for a minute or two,
when he was younger; but that he had by much self-restraint chiefly
if not quite subdued it. It was true; and the temper never need be
feared now unless he took anything to excite him. Dan had the same
temper; but without the good-nature. And they said Hetta had; but
we saw nothing of it in her. Hetta was eighteen, a nice-looking girl,
who was governess to little Ruth, or pretended to be; but Ruth would
manage to escape her lessons five days in the week. It was all the
same to Mrs. Sanker whether she did them or whether she didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>At the time of this visit of ours to Worcester, the college school was
in a ferment. Between the Cathedral and St. Peter&rsquo;s Church was
situated a poor, back district called Frog Lane. It had been rechristened
Diglis Street, but was chiefly called by the old name still.
Crowded dwellings, narrow streets, noise and dirt&mdash;that&rsquo;s how the place
struck me. The inhabitants were chiefly workmen belonging to the
glove and china manufactories of the town. In this district was the
parish school, always filled with boys, sons of the working-men, and
under the superintendence of Mr. Jones, the portly parish clerk. Now
there was wont to spring up from time to time a tide of animosity
between these boys and the boys of the college school. Captain Sanker
said it was the fault of the college boys: had they let the St. Peter&rsquo;s
boys alone, St. Peter&rsquo;s boys would never have presumed to interfere
with them: but the college boys could be downright contemptuous and
overbearing when they pleased. They scornfully called the St. Peter&rsquo;s
boys the Frogs, &ldquo;charity boys;&rdquo; and the Frogs retorted by calling them
the College Caws&mdash;after the rooks that had their homes in the old
trees of the college green and kept up a perpetual cawing. The
animosity generally ended in a grand battle; and then hostilities would
be dropped for months, perhaps years. One of these quarrels was
going on while we were at Worcester; it had kept both schools in a
ferment for some weeks, and there was every sign of a culminating
fight. Of course we went in heart and soul with the king&rsquo;s scholars:
but the boys on both sides held a code of honour&mdash;if you can call it so&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
no stranger must take part in the engagements. The college
boys were only forty, all told; the Frogs seemed to number four times
as many.</p>

<p>Skirmishes took place daily&mdash;the scene being the top of Edgar Street.
St. Peter&rsquo;s boys (let out of school at twelve, whereas the others did not
get out till one) would collect in the narrow neck of their district opening
on Edgar Street, and wait for the enemy. As soon as the college
boys&rsquo; steps were heard racing under the dark gateway of Edgar Tower,
hisses and groans began. &ldquo;Caw, caw, caw! Hiss, hiss, hiss! How&rsquo;s
your Latin to-day?&mdash;what birchings has you had? Call yourselves
gents, does you, you College Caws? You daren&rsquo;t come on fair, and
fight it out with us, you Caws. Caw, caw, caw!&rdquo; Sometimes the
college boys would pass on, only calling back their contemptuous
retorts; sometimes they&rsquo;d halt, and a fierce storm of abuse would be
interchanged, to the edification of Edgar Street in general and the
clerks in Mr. Clifton&rsquo;s Registry Office. &ldquo;You beggarly Frogs! We
don&rsquo;t care to soil our hands with you! Had you been gentlemen, we&rsquo;d
have polished you off long ago, and sent you into next week. Croak,
Frogs! Croak!&rdquo; Not a third of the college boys need have taken
Edgar Tower on their way home; through the cloisters and out by St.
Michael&rsquo;s churchyard would have been their direct way; but they chose
to meet the Frogs. Once in a way there&rsquo;d be a single combat; but as
a rule nothing came of it but abuse. When that was exhausted, each
lot would rush home their separate ways: the Frogs back down Frog
Lane; the others up the steps, or onwards down Edgar Street, as their
road might lie, and remain apart till the same hour next day.</p>

<p>I have not said much yet about King Sanker. He was lame: something
was wrong with his knee. Gatherings would come in it, and
then he&rsquo;d be in bed for weeks together. He was nearly thirteen then;
next to Dan: and Dan was over fourteen. King was a nice little
fellow, with mild eyes as blue as the captain&rsquo;s: Fred would order him
to keep &ldquo;out of the ruck&rdquo; in the skirmishes with the Frogs, and he
generally did. If it came to a fight, you see, King might have been
hurt; he had no fighting in him, was frightened at it, and he could not
run much. King was just like his mother in ideas: he would tell us
his dreams as she did, and recite pieces of poetry a mile long. Dan
and King slept together in the room next to ours; it was in the garret,
close to the turret-room. King would keep us awake singing; sometimes
chants, sometimes hymns, sometimes songs. They&rsquo;d have let
him try for the choir, but the head-master of the college school thought
his knee would not do for it.</p>

<p>It was Saturday, and a pouring wet afternoon. Our visit was drawing
to an end; on the following Wednesday we should bid the Sankers
good-bye. Captain Sanker, always trying to find out ways of making
folk happy, had devised a day of pleasure for the last day of our stay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Tuesday. We were to go to Malvern; a whole lot of us: ourselves,
and the Teals, and the Squire, and Mrs. Todhetley, and take our dinner
on the hill. It was so settled; and the arrangements were planned
and made.</p>

<p>But this was yet only Saturday. We dined at twelve: whether for
any one&rsquo;s convenience or that the servants made a mistake in an hour,
I don&rsquo;t remember. It happened to be a saint&rsquo;s day, so the boys had no
school; and, being wet, came home after morning service in the
cathedral. After a jolly dinner of peas and bacon and pancakes, we
looked at the skies for a bit, and then (all but Fred and Hetta) went
up to the turret-room. Dan said the rain had come to spite us; for
the whole school had meant to race to Berwick&rsquo;s Bridge after afternoon
service and hold a mock review in the fields there. It was coming
down in torrents, peppering the roof and the windows. Mrs. Sanker
sat in the middle of the old beam, mending one of Toby&rsquo;s shirts,
&ldquo;Lalla Rookh&rdquo; open on her knee, out of which she was singing softly;
the floor was strewed with patches, and scissors, and tapes, and the
combs were out of one side of her hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Read it out loud to us, mamma,&rdquo; cried King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t spare time to read, King,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Look here&rdquo;&mdash;holding
out the work, all rags and tatters. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t mend this, Toby
won&rsquo;t have a shirt to put on to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t mind about that,&rdquo; said Toby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but, dear, I don&rsquo;t think you could go without a shirt. Has
any one seen my cotton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then say something over to us that you know, mamma,&rdquo; returned
King, as Toby found the cotton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. I can do that and work too. Sit down, all of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We sat down, King and Toby on the floor before her, the rest of
on the beam on either side her. Dan, who did not care for poetry,
got some Brazil nuts out of his pocket and cracked them while he
listened.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sanker might as well have read &ldquo;Lalla Rookh.&rdquo; She began
to recite &ldquo;The Friar of Orders Grey.&rdquo; But what with gazing up at
the sky through the rain to give it due emphasis, and shaking her head
at pathetic parts, the sewing did not get on. She had finished the
verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Weep no more, lady, weep no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy sorrow is in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For violets plucked, the sweetest showers<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will ne&rsquo;er make grow again,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>when King surprised us by bursting into tears. But as Mrs. Sanker
took no notice, I supposed it was nothing unusual.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You young donkey!&rdquo; cried Dan, when the poem was finished.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never be a man, King.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is such a nice verse, Dan,&rdquo; replied young King, meekly. &ldquo;I
whisper it over sometimes to myself in bed. Mamma, won&rsquo;t you say
the &lsquo;Barber&rsquo;s Ghost&rsquo;? Johnny Ludlow would like to hear that, I
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had the &ldquo;Barber&rsquo;s Ghost,&rdquo; which was humorous, and we had
other things. After that, Mrs. Sanker told a dreadful story about a
real ghost, one that she said haunted her family, and another of a
murder that was discovered by a dream. Some of the young Sankers
were the oddest mixtures of timidity and bravery&mdash;personally brave
in fighting; frightfully timid as to being alone in the dark&mdash;and I
no longer wondered at it if she brought them up on these ghostly
dishes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should not like to have dreams that would tell me of murders,&rdquo;
said King, thoughtfully. &ldquo;But I do dream very strange dreams sometimes.
When I awake, I lie and wonder what they mean. Once I
dreamt I saw heaven&mdash;didn&rsquo;t I, mamma? It was so beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay; my family have always been dreamers,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Sanker.</p>

<p>Thus, what with ghosts and poetry and talking, the afternoon wore
on unconsciously. Dan suddenly started up with a shout&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sun had come out. Come out, and we had never noticed it. It
was shining as brightly as could be on the slates of all the houses. The
rain had ceased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, we shall have the review yet!&rdquo; cried Dan. &ldquo;And, by
Jupiter, that&rsquo;s the college bell! Make a rush, you fellows, or you&rsquo;ll be
marked late. There&rsquo;s three o&rsquo;clock striking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s scholars thought it a great shame that they should have
to attend prayers in the cathedral morning and afternoon on saints&rsquo;
days, instead of wholly benefiting by the holiday. They had to do it,
however. The three went flying out towards the cathedral, and I gave
King my arm to help him after them. Tod and I&mdash;intending to take
part in the review at Berwick&rsquo;s Bridge&mdash;went to college also, and sat
behind the surpliced king&rsquo;s scholars on the decani side, in the stalls
next to the chanter.</p>

<p>But for a little mud, you&rsquo;d hardly have thought there had been any
rain when we got out again; and the sun was glowing in the blue sky.
Not a single fellow was absent: even King limped along. We took
the way by the Severn, past the boat-house at the end of the college
boundaries, and went leisurely along the towing-path, intending to get
into the fields beyond Diglis Wharf, and so onwards.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe there was a thought in any one&rsquo;s mind that afternoon
of the enemy. The talk&mdash;and a good hubbub it was&mdash;turned wholly
upon soldiers and reviews. A regular review of the Worcestershire
militia took place once a year on Kempsey Ham, and some of the boys&rsquo;
heads got a trifle turned with it. They were envying Lord Ward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
now, as they went along: saying they should like to be him, and look
as well as he did, and sit his horse as proudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he&rsquo;s proud,&rdquo; squeaked out the biggest Teal, whose voice
was uncertain. &ldquo;Think of his money!&mdash;and his horses!&mdash;and see how
good-looking he is! If Lord Ward hasn&rsquo;t a right to be proud, I should
like to know who has. Why, he&mdash;oh, by George! I say, look
here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turning into the first field, we found we had turned into a company
of Frogs. All the whole lot, it seemed. Caws and croaks and hoots
and groans from either side rose at once on the air. Which army
commenced hostilities, I couldn&rsquo;t tell; the one was as eager for it as
the other; and in two minutes the battle had begun&mdash;begun in earnest.
Up dashed the senior boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said he to me and Tod; &ldquo;you understand our rules.
You must neither of you attempt to meddle in this. Stay and look on,
if you please; but keep at a sufficient distance where it may be seen
that you are simply spectators. These beggars shan&rsquo;t have it to say
that we were helped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He dashed back again. Tod ground his teeth with the effort it took
to keep himself from going in to pummel some of the Frogs. Being
upon honour, he had to refrain; and he did it somehow.</p>

<p>The Frogs had the blazing sun in their eyes; our side had it at their
backs&mdash;which was against the Frogs. There were no weapons of any
sort; only arms and hands. It looked like the scrimmage of an Irish
row. Sometimes there was closing-in, and fighting hand to hand;
sometimes the forces were drawn back again, each to its respective
ground. During the first of these interludes, just as the sides were
preparing to charge, a big Frog, with broad awkward shoulders, a red,
rugged face, and a bleeding nose, came dashing forward alone into the
ranks of the college boys, caught up poor lame helpless King Sanker,
bore him bravely right through, and put him down in safety beyond, in
spite of the blows freely showered upon him. Not a soul on our side
had thought of King; and the college boys were too excited to see
what the big Frog was about, or they&rsquo;d perhaps have granted him grace
to pass unmolested. King sat down on the wet grass for a bit, and
gazed about him like a fellow bewildered. Seeing me and Tod he
came limping round to us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was good-natured of that big Frog, wasn&rsquo;t it, Johnny Ludlow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very. He&rsquo;d make a brave soldier. I mean a real soldier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I should have been killed, but for him. I was frightened,
you see; and there was no way out. I couldn&rsquo;t have kept on my legs
a minute longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The battle raged. The cawing and the croaking, that had been kept
up like an array of trumpets, fell off as the fighting waxed hotter. The
work grew too fierce and real for abuse of tongue. We could hear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
blows dealt on the upturned faces. King, who had a natural horror of
fighting, trembled inwardly from head to foot, and hid his face behind
me. Tod was dancing with excitement, flinging his closed fists outward
in imaginary battle, and roaring out like a dragon.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say who would have won had they been left alone. Probably
the Frogs, for there were a great many more of them. But on the
other hand, none of them were so old as some of the college boys.
When the fight was at the thickest, we heard a sudden shout from a
bass, gruff, authoritative voice: &ldquo;Now then, boys, how dare you!&rdquo;
and saw a big, portly gentleman in black clothes and a white necktie,
appear behind the Frogs, with a stout stick in his hand.</p>

<p>It was Clerk Jones, their master. His presence and his voice acted
like magic. Not a Frog of them all but dropped his blows and his
rage. The college boys had to drop theirs, as the enemy receded.
Clerk Jones put himself between the two sets of combatants.</p>

<p>The way he went on at both sides was something good to hear.
Shaking his stick at his own boys, they turned tail softly, and then
rushed away through the mud like wild horses, not waiting to hear the
close: so the college boys had the pepper intended for the lot. He
vowed and declared by the stick that was in his hand&mdash;and he had the
greatest mind, he interrupted himself to say, to put it about <em>their</em> backs&mdash;that
if ever they molested his boys again, or another quarrel was got
up, he would appeal publicly to the dean and chapter. If one of the
college boys made a move in future to so much as cast an insulting
look towards a boy in St. Peter&rsquo;s School, that boy should go before the
dean; and it would not be his fault (the clerk&rsquo;s) if he was not expelled
the cathedral. <em>He</em> would take care, and precious good care, that his
boys should preserve civility henceforth; and it was no great favour to
expect that the college boys would do so. For his part he should feel
ashamed in their places to oppress lads in an inferior class of life to
themselves; and he should make it his business before he slept to see
the head-master of the college school, and report this present disgraceful
scene to him: the head-master could deal with it as he pleased.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones went off, flourishing his stick; and our side began to sum
up its damages: closed eyes, scratched faces, swollen noses, and torn
clothes. Dan Sanker&rsquo;s nose was as big as a beer barrel, and his shirt-front
hung in ribbons. Fred&rsquo;s eyes were black. Toby&rsquo;s jacket had a
sleeve slit up, and one of his boots had disappeared for good.</p>

<p>The spectacle we made, going home down the Gloucester Road,
could not be easily forgotten. Folks collected on the pavement, and
came to the windows and doors to see the sight. It was like an army
of soldiers returning from battle. Bleeding faces, black eyes, clothes
tattered and bespattered with mud. Farmers going back from market
drew up their gigs to the roadside, to stare at us while we passed. One
little girl, in a pony-chaise, wedged between a fat old lady in a red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
shawl and a gentleman in top-boots, was frightened nearly into fits.
She shrieked and cried, till you might have heard her up at Mr.
Allies&rsquo;s; and the old lady could not pacify her. The captain was out
when we got in: and Mrs. Sanker took it all with her usual apathy,
only saying we had better have come straight home from college to
hear some more poetry.</p>

<p>An awful fuss was made by the head-master. Especially as the boys
had to appear on Sunday at the cathedral services. Damages were
visible on many of them; and their white surplices only helped to show
the faces off the more. The chorister who took the solo in the afternoon
anthem was decorated with cuttings of sticking-plaster; he looked like
a tattooed young Indian.</p>

<p>The school broke up on the Monday: and on that day Mr. and Mrs.
Todhetley drove into Worcester, and put up at the Star and Garter.
They came to us in the afternoon, as had been agreed upon; dinner
being ordered by Captain Sanker for five o&rsquo;clock. It was rather a
profuse dinner; fish and meat and pies and dessert, but quite a
scramble of confusion: which none of the Sankers seemed to notice or
to mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny dear, is it <em>always</em> like this?&rdquo; Mrs. Todhetley could not
help asking me, in a whisper. &ldquo;I should be in a lunatic asylum in a
week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We started for Malvern on Tuesday at eleven o&rsquo;clock. The Squire
drove Bob and Blister in his high carriage: Dr. Teal, Captain Sanker,
and Fred sitting with him. There was no railroad then. The ladies
and the girls crammed themselves into a post-carriage from the Star,
and a big waggonette was lent by some friend of Dr. Teal for the rest.
The boys were losing the signs of their damages; nothing being very
conspicuous now but Dan&rsquo;s nose. It refused to go down at all in size,
and in colour was brighter than a rainbow. The Teals kept laughing
at it, which made Dan savage; once he burst out in a passion, wishing
all the Frogs were shot.</p>

<p>I remember that drive still. John Teal and I sat on the box of the
post-carriage, the post-boy riding his horses. I remember the different
features of the road as we passed them&mdash;not but that I knew them well
before; I remember the laden orchards, and the sweet scent of the
bean-fields, in flower then. Over the bridge from Worcester went we,
up the New Road and through St. John&rsquo;s, and then into the open
country; past Lower Wick, where Mrs. Sherwood lived, and on to
Powick across its bridge. I remember that a hearse and three
mourning-coaches stood before the Lion, the men refreshing themselves
with drink; and we wondered who was being buried that day. Down
that steep and awkward hill next, where so many accidents occurred
before it was altered, and so on to the Link; the glorious hills always
before us from the turning where they had first burst into view; their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
clumps of gorse and broom, their paths and their sheep-tracks growing
gradually plainer to the sight the nearer we drew. The light and
shade cast by the sun swept over them perpetually, a landscape ever
changing; the white houses of the village, nestling amidst their dark
foliage, looked fair for the eye to rest upon. Youth, as we all get to
learn when it has gone by, lends a charm that later life cannot know:
but never a scene that I have seen since, abroad or at home, lies on my
memory with half the beauty as does that old approach to Malvern.
Turning round to the left at the top of the Link, we drove into Great
Malvern.</p>

<p>The carriages were left at the Crown. An old pony was chartered
for some of the provisions, and we boys carried the rest. The people
at St. Ann&rsquo;s Well had been written to, and the room behind the well
was in readiness for us. Once the baskets were deposited there, we
were at liberty till dinner-time, and went on up the hill. Turning a
corner which had hidden the upper landscape from view, we came upon
Dan Sanker, who had got on first. He was standing to confront us, his
face big with excitement, his nose flaming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll believe me, those cursed Frogs are here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In angry consternation&mdash;for the Frogs seemed to have no business
to be at Malvern&mdash;we rushed on, turned another corner, and so brought
ourselves into a wide expanse of upper prospect. Sure enough!
About a hundred of the Frogs in their Sunday clothes were trooping
down the hill. They had the start of us in arriving at Malvern, and
had been to the top already.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;be&mdash;jiggered!&rdquo; cried Dan, savagely. &ldquo;What a horrid lot they
are! Look at their sneaking tail-coats. Wouldn&rsquo;t I like to pitch into
them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The college school wore the Eton jacket. Those preposterous coats,
the tails docked to the size of the boys, did not improve the appearance
of the Frogs. But as to pitching-in, Dan did not dare to do it after
what had passed. It was his nose that made him so resentful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I desire that you will behave as gentlemen,&rdquo; said Captain Sanker,
who was behind with the Squire, and bid us halt. &ldquo;Those poor boys
are here, I see; but they will not, I am sure, molest you, neither must
you molest them. Civility costs nothing, remember. What are you
looking so cross for, Dan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, papa, it&rsquo;s like their impudence, to come here to-day!&rdquo;
muttered Dan.</p>

<p>The captain laughed. &ldquo;They may say it&rsquo;s like yours, to come,
Dan: they were here first. Go on, lads, and don&rsquo;t forget yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod&rsquo;s whistle below was heard just then; and Dan, not caring to
show his nose to the enemy, responded, and galloped back. We went
on. The paths there are narrow, you know, and we expected to have
all the string of Frogs sweeping past us, their coats brushing our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
jackets. But&mdash;perhaps not caring to meet us any more than we cared
to meet them&mdash;most of them broke off on a detour down the steep of
the hill, and so avoided us. About half-a-dozen came on. One of them
was a big-shouldered, awkward, red-faced boy, taller than the rest of
them and not unlike a real frog; he walked with his cap in his hand,
and his brown hair stood on end like a porcupine&rsquo;s. Indisputably ugly
was he, with a mouth as wide as a frying-pan; but it was a pleasant
and honest face, for all that. King suddenly darted to him as he was
passing, and pulled him towards Captain Sanker, in excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa, this is the one I told you of; the one who saved me and
didn&rsquo;t mind the blows he got in doing it. I should have been knocked
down, and my knee trampled on, but for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Out went Captain Sanker&rsquo;s hand to shake the boy&rsquo;s. He did
it heartily. As to the Frog, he blushed redder than before with
modesty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a brave lad, and I thank you heartily,&rdquo; said the captain,
wringing his hand as though he&rsquo;d wring it off. &ldquo;You do honour to
yourself, whoever you may be. There was not one of his own companions
to think of him, and save him, and you did it in the midst of
danger. Thank you, my lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain slid half-a-crown into his hand, telling him to get some
Malvern cakes. The boy stood back for us to go by. I was the last,
and he spoke as if he knew me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-day, Master Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why, who was he? And, now I came to look at his freckled face,
it seemed quite familiar. His great wide mouth brought me remembrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Mark Ferrar! I didn&rsquo;t know you at first, Mark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come over here for the day in two vans,&rdquo; said Mark, putting
his grey cap on. &ldquo;Eighty of the biggest of us; the rest are to come
to-morrow. Some gent that&rsquo;s visiting at St. Peter&rsquo;s parsonage has given
us the treat, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Mark. I&rsquo;m glad you thought of King Sanker on
Saturday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ferrar touched his cap, and went vaulting down after his comrades.
He was related to Daniel Ferrar, the Squire&rsquo;s bailiff, of whom you have
heard before, poor fellow, and also to the Batleys of South Crabb. He
used to come over to Crabb, that&rsquo;s where I had seen him.</p>

<p>Some donkeys came running down the hill, their white cloths flying.
Captain Sanker stopped one and put King on him&mdash;for King was tired
already. We soon got to the top then, and to Lady Harcourt&rsquo;s Tower.
Oh, it was a glorious day! The great wide prospect around stood out
in all its beauty. The vale of Herefordshire on the one side with its
rural plains and woods basked in the sunshine, its crops of ruddy pears
and apples giving token of the perry and cider to come; on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
side rose the more diversified landscape that has been so much told and
talked of. Over the green meadows and the ripening corn-fields lay
Worcester itself: the cathedral showing out well, and the summit of the
high church-spire of St. Andrew&rsquo;s catching a glint of the sunlight.
Hills caught the eye wherever it turned: Bredon Hill, Abberleigh
Hills, the Old Hills; homesteads lay upon their lands, half hidden by
their rick-yards and clustering trees; cattle and sheep browsed on the
grass or lay in the shade to shelter themselves from the midday sun.
To the right, on the verge of the horizon, far, far away, might be
caught a glimpse of something that sparkled like a bed of stars&mdash;the
Bristol Channel. It is not often you can discern that from
Malvern, but this day that I am telling of was one of the clearest
ever seen there; the atmosphere looking quite rarefied in spite of the
sunlight.</p>

<p>King&rsquo;s donkey regaled himself with morsels of herbage, the donkey-boy
lay stretched beside him, and we boys raced about. When an
hour or two had passed, and we were as hot as fire and more hungry
than hunters, we bethought ourselves of dinner. King got on his
donkey again, and the rest of us whipped him up. When half-way
down we saw Dr. Teal gesticulating and shouting, telling us to come on
and not keep dinner waiting longer.</p>

<p>We had it in the room behind the well. It was a squeeze to sit
round the table. Cold meats, and salad, and pastry, and all sorts of
good things. Dan was next to me; he said he could hardly eat for
thirst, and kept drinking away at the bottled ale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Todhetley to him by-and-by, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think
you had better drink some water instead&mdash;or lemonade? This bottled
ale is very strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid it is,&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go in for the tarts now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room was stuffy; and after dinner a table was carried out to a
sheltered place near the well: not much better than a little ledge of a
path, but where we could not be overlooked, and should be quite out of
the way of the hill-climbers. The bank rose perpendicularly above us,
banks descended beneath to goodness knew where; there we sat at
dessert, all sheltered. I think dark trees and shrubs overshaded us;
but I am not altogether sure.</p>

<p>How it came about, I hardly know: but something was brought up
about King&rsquo;s store of ballads, and he was asked to give us his favourite
one, &ldquo;Lord Bateman,&rdquo; for the benefit of the company. He turned very
shy, but Captain Sanker told him not to be silly: and after going white
and red for a bit, he began. Perhaps the reader would like to hear it.
I never repeat it to myself, no, nor even a verse of it, but poor King
Sanker comes before me just as I saw him that day, his back to the
ravine below, his eyes looking at nothing, his thin hands nervously
twisting some paper about that had covered the basket of raspberries.</p>

<p>King stopped, just as shyly as he had begun. Some laughed, others
applauded him; and the Squire told us that the first time he had ever
heard &ldquo;Lord Bateman&rdquo; was in Sconton&rsquo;s show, on Worcester racecourse,
many a year ago.</p>

<p>After that, we broke up. I and some of the boys climbed up straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
to Lady Harcourt&rsquo;s Tower again. A few Frogs were about the hills,
but they did not come in contact with us. When we got back to St.
Ann&rsquo;s the tea was ready in the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I wish to goodness they&rsquo;d have it,&rdquo; cried Dan, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m as
thirsty as a fish. I&rsquo;ve been asleep out there all the while on the bench
in the sun. Can&rsquo;t we have tea, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as ever the gentlemen come back,&rdquo; spoke up Mrs. Teal,
who seemed to like order. &ldquo;They went down to look at the Abbey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were coming up then, puffing over the walk; Tod and Fred
Sanker with them. We sat down to tea; and it was half over when
the two young Sankers, King and Toby, were missed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tiresome monkeys!&rdquo; cried the captain. &ldquo;I never came over here
with a party yet, but we had to spend the last hour or two hunting
some of them up. Well, I&rsquo;ll not bother myself over it: they shall find
their way home as they can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toby ran in presently. He had only been about the hills, he said,
and had not seen King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say King&rsquo;s still in the place where we had dessert,&rdquo; said
Hetta Sanker, just then thinking of it. &ldquo;He stayed behind us all,
saying he was tired. You boys can go and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I and Jim Teal ran off together. King was not there. One of the
women at the well said that when she went out for the chairs and
things, just before tea-time, nobody was there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll turn up presently,&rdquo; said the captain. And we went on
with our tea, and forgot him.</p>

<p>It was twilight when we got down to the village to start for home.
The Squire set off first: the same party with him as in the morning,
except that Mrs. Teal took her husband&rsquo;s place. When they were
bringing out the post-carriage, King was again thought of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has stayed somewhere singing to himself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sanker.</p>

<p>We went off in different directions, shouting our throats hoarse. Up
as far as St. Ann&rsquo;s, and along the hill underneath, and in all the
corners of the village: no King. It was getting strange.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should hope none of those impudent Frogs have made off with
him!&rdquo; cried Toby Sanker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are capable of anything, mind you,&rdquo; added Dan.</p>

<p>One vanload of Frogs had started; the other was getting ready to
start. The boys, gaping and listening about, saw and heard all our
consternation at the dilemma we were in. Mrs. Todhetley, who did
not understand the state of social politics, as between them and the
college school, turned and inquired whether they had seen King.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A delicate lad, who walks lame,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;We think he
must have fallen asleep somewhere on the hill: and we cannot start
without him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Frogs showed themselves good-natured; and went tearing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
towards the hill to look for King. In passing the Unicorn, a pleasure-party
of young men and women, carrying their empty provision-baskets,
came running downwards, saying that they had heard groaning under a
part of the hill&mdash;and described where. I seemed to catch the right
place, as if by instinct, and was up there first. King was lying there;
not groaning then, but senseless or dead.</p>

<p>Looking upwards to note the position, we thought he must have
fallen down from the place where we had sat at dessert. Hetta Sanker
said she had left him there by himself, to rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must have dropped asleep, and fallen down,&rdquo; cried Dr. Teal.</p>

<p>King came to as they lifted him, and walked a few steps; but looked
around and fell aside as though his head were dazed. Dr. Teal thought
that there was not much the matter, and that he might be conveyed to
Worcester. Ferrar helped to carry him down the hill, and the other
Frogs followed. A fine fury their van-driver was in, at their having
kept him waiting!</p>

<p>King was made comfortable along the floor of the waggonette, upon
some rugs and blankets lent by the Crown; and so was taken home.
When Captain Sanker found what had happened, he grew excited, and
went knocking at half the doctors&rsquo; doors in Worcester. Mr. Woodward
was the first in, then Dr. Malden and Mr. Carden came running
together. By what the captain had said, they expected to find all the
house dead.</p>

<p>King seemed better in the morning. The injury lay chiefly in his
head. We did not hear what the doctors made of it. He was sensible,
and talked a little. When asked how he came to fall, all he said was
that he &ldquo;went over and could not save himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Coming in, from carrying the news of how he was to the Squire and
Mrs. Todhetley at the Star, I found Mark Ferrar at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Johnny,&rdquo; said he, in a low voice, his plain face all concern,
&ldquo;how did it happen? Sure he was not pushed over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not. Why do you ask it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ferrar paused. &ldquo;Master Johnny, when boys are lame they are more
cautious. He&rsquo;d hardly be likely to slip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might in walking. It&rsquo;s only a narrow ledge there. And his
sister says she thinks he went to sleep when she left him. She was
the last who saw him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mark&rsquo;s wide mouth went into all sorts of contortions, and the freckles
shone in the sun in his effort to get the next words out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancy it was me that saw him last, Master Johnny. Leastways,
later than his sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you? How was that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must have seen me near the place, and he called to me. There
was nobody there but him, and some chairs and a table and glasses and
things. He asked me to sit down, and began telling me he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
saying &lsquo;Lord Bateman&rsquo; to them all. I didn&rsquo;t know what &lsquo;Lord Bateman&rsquo;
meant, Master Johnny&mdash;and he said he would tell it me; he
should not mind then, but he had minded saying it to the company.
It was poetry, I found; but he stopped in the middle, and told me to
go then, for he saw some of them coming&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of what?&rdquo; I interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I took it to mean some of his grown-up party, or else the
college boys. Anyway, he seemed to want me gone, sir, and I went off
at once. I didn&rsquo;t see him after that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must have fallen asleep, and somehow slipped over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. What a pity he was left in that shallow place!&rdquo;</p>

<p>King seemed to have all his wits about him, but his face had a
white, odd look in it. He lay in a room on the first floor, that belonged
in general to the two girls. When I said Mark Ferrar was outside,
King asked me to take him up. But I did not like taking him without
speaking to Captain Sanker; and I went to him in the parlour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea of a Frog coming into our house!&rdquo; cried resentful Dan,
as he heard me. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like his impudence to stop outside it! What
next? Let him wait till King&rsquo;s well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hold your tongue, Dan,&rdquo; cried the captain. &ldquo;The boy shall
go up, whether he&rsquo;s a Frog, or whether he&rsquo;s one of you. Take him up,
Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not look unlike a frog when he got into the room, with his
wide, red, freckled face and his great wide mouth&mdash;but, as I have said,
it was a face to be trusted. The first thing he did, looking at King,
was to burst into a great blubber of tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll get well,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might have been as bad as this in the fight, but for your pulling
me out of it, Frog,&rdquo; said King, in his faint voice. And he did not call
him Frog in any contempt, but as though it were his name: he knew
him by no other. &ldquo;Was that bump done in the battle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mark had his cap off: on one side of his forehead, under the hair,
we saw a big lump the size of an egg. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;it was
got in the fight. Father thinks it never means to go down. It&rsquo;s pretty
stiff and sore yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>King sighed. He was gazing up at the lump with his nice blue
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;ll be any fighting in heaven,&rdquo; said King.
&ldquo;And I wrote out &lsquo;Lord Bateman&rsquo; the other day, and they shall give
it you to keep. I didn&rsquo;t finish telling it to you. He owned half
Northumberland; and he married her after all. She had set him free
from the prison, you know, Frog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Frog, quite bewildered, and looking as though he
could not make top or tail of the story. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll get well, sir.
How came you to fall?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they expect me to get well: they wouldn&rsquo;t have so
many doctors if they did. I shan&rsquo;t be lame, Frog, up there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you slip?&mdash;or did anybody push you?&rdquo; went on Frog, lowering
his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said King, glancing at the door. &ldquo;If papa heard you say
that, he might go into a passion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;was it a slip&mdash;or were you pushed over?&rdquo; persisted Frog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My leg is always slipping: it has never been of much good to me,&rdquo;
answered King. &ldquo;When you come up there, and see me with a
beautiful strong body and straight limbs, you won&rsquo;t know me again at
first. Good-bye, till then, Frog; good-bye. It was very kind of you
to carry me out of the fight, and God saw you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, sir,&rdquo; said Frog, with another burst, as he put out his
hand to meet poor King&rsquo;s white one. &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll get over it yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod and I took leave of them in the afternoon, and went up to the
Star. The Squire wanted to be home early. The carriage was waiting
before the gateway, the ostler holding the heads of Bob and Blister,
when Captain Sanker came up in dreadful excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;My poor King&rsquo;s gone. He died as
the clock was striking four.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And we had supposed King to be going on well! The Squire ordered
the horses to be put up again, and we went down to the house. The
boys and girls were all crying.</p>

<p>King lay stretched on the bed, his face very peaceful and looking less
white than I had sometimes seen it look in life. On the cheeks there
lingered a faint colour; his forehead felt warm; you could hardly
believe he was dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has gone to the heaven he talked of,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sanker, through
her tears. &ldquo;He has been talking about it at intervals all day&mdash;and
now he is there; and has his harp amongst the angels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that was the result of our Day of Pleasure! The force of those
solemn words has rarely been brought home to hearts as it was to ours
then: &ldquo;In the midst of life we are in death.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><span class="f9">XI.</span><br />

THE FINAL ENDING TO IT.</h2>


<p>Of all the gloomy houses any one ever stayed in, Captain Sanker&rsquo;s was
the worst. Nothing but coffins coming into it, and all of us stealing
about on tip-toe. King lay in the room where he died. There was to
be an inquest: at which the captain was angry. But he was so excited
and sorrowful just then as to have no head at all.</p>

<p>Which might well be excused in him. Picture what it was! Three
carriages full of us had started on the Tuesday morning, expecting to
have a day of charming pleasure on the Malvern Hills in the July sunshine;
no more thinking of death or any other catastrophe, than if the
world had never contained such! And poor King&mdash;poor lame King,
whose weakness made him more helpless than were we strong ones, and
who only on the previous Saturday had been plucked out of the fight in
Diglis Meadow and been saved&mdash;King must fall asleep on a dangerous
part of the hill and roll down it and come home to die! &ldquo;Better King
than any of the rest of you,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Sanker, more than once, in her
dreamy way, and with her eyes dry, for she seemed tired of tears; &ldquo;he
could never have done battle with the world as you will have to do it;
and he was quite ready for heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instead of going home with our people the day after the death, as
Tod did, I had to wait at Worcester for the inquest. When the beadle
(or whoever the officer might be; he had gold cord on his hat and
white ribbed stockings below his breeches: which stockings might have
been fellows to old Jones&rsquo;s of Church Dykely) came to Captain Sanker&rsquo;s
to make inquiries the night of the death, and heard that I had been
first up with King after his fall, he said I should have to give evidence.
So I stayed on with them&mdash;much to my uneasiness.</p>

<p>If I had thought the Sankers queer people before, I thought them
queerer now. Not one of the boys and girls, except Fred, cared to go
alone by the door of the room where King lay. And, talking of King,
it was not until I saw the name on the coffin-lid that I knew his name
was not King, but Kingsley. He looked as nice and peaceful as any
dead lad with a nice face could look; and yet they were afraid to pass
by outside. Dan and Ruth were the worst. I did not wonder at her&mdash;she
was a little girl; but I did at Dan. Fred told me that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
they were children a servant used to tell them stories of ghosts and
dreams and banshees; Hetta and he were too old to be frightened,
but the rest had taken it all into their nature. I privately thought that
Mrs. Sanker was no better than the fool of a servant, reciting to them
her dreams and accounts of apparitions.</p>

<p>King died on the Wednesday afternoon. On Thursday afternoon the
inquest took place. It was held at the Angel Inn, in Sidbury, and
Mr. Robert Allies was the foreman. Boys don&rsquo;t give evidence on
inquests every day: I felt shy and uncomfortable at having to do it;
and perhaps that may be the reason why the particulars remain so
strongly on my memory. The time fixed was three o&rsquo;clock, but it
was nearly four when they came down to look at King: the coroner
explained to the jury that he had been detained. When they went
back to the Angel Inn we followed them&mdash;Captain Sanker, Fred, and I.</p>

<p>All sorts of nonsense ran about the town. It was reported that
there had been a fight with the Frogs on Malvern Hill, during which
King had been pitched over. This was only laughed at by those who
knew how foundationless it was. Not a shadow of cause existed for
supposing it to have been anything but a pure accident.</p>

<p>The coroner and jury sat at a long table covered with green baize.
The coroner had his clerk by him; and on one side Mr. Allies sat
Captain Chamberlain, on the other side Mr. Allcroft. Dr. Teal and
Mr. Woodward were present, and gave the medical evidence in a most
learned manner. Reduced to plainness, it meant that King had died
of an injury to the head.</p>

<p>When my turn came, what they chiefly asked me was, whether I
had seen or heard any quarrelling with St. Peter&rsquo;s boys that day at
Malvern. None whatever, I answered. Was I quite sure of that?
pursued one&mdash;it was Mr. Allcroft. I did not think there had been, or
could have been, I repeated: we and the charity boys had kept apart
from each other all day. Then another of the jury, Mr. Stone, put
some questions, and then Mr. Allen&mdash;I thought they were never going
to believe me. So I said it was the opposite of quarrelling, and told of
Captain Sanker&rsquo;s giving one of them half-a-crown because he had been
kind to King on Saturday, and of some of the boys&mdash;all who had not
gone home in the first van&mdash;having helped us to look for King at night.
After they had turned me inside out, the coroner could say that these
questions were merely put for form&rsquo;s sake and for the satisfaction of the
public.</p>

<p>When the witnesses were done with, the coroner spoke to the jury.
I suppose it was his charge. It seemed all as plain as a turnpike, he
said: the poor little lame boy had slipped and fallen. The probability
was that he had dropped asleep too near the edge of the perpendicular
bank, and had either fallen over <em>in</em> his sleep, or in the act of awaking.
He (the coroner) thought it must have been the former, as no cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
appeared to have been made, or heard. Under these circumstances, he
believed the jury could have no difficulty in arriving at their verdict.</p>

<p>The last word, &ldquo;verdict,&rdquo; was still on his tongue, when some commotion
took place at the end of the room. A working-man, in his shirt-sleeves
and a leather apron on, was pushing in through the crowd at
the door, making straight for the table and the coroner. Some of the
jury knew him for John Dance, a glove-cutter at a Quaker gentleman&rsquo;s
manufactory hard by. He begged pardon of the gentlefolk for coming
amid &rsquo;em abrupt like that, he said, just as he was, but something had
but now come to his hearing about the poor little boy who had died.
It made him fear he had not fell of himself, but been flung over, and
he had thought it his duty to come and tell it.</p>

<p>The consternation this suggestion created, delivered in its homely
words, would not be easy to describe. Captain Sanker, who had been
sitting against the wall, got up in agitation. John Dance was asked
his grounds for what he said, and was entering into a long rigmarole of
a tale when the coroner stopped him, and bade him simply say how it
had come to his own knowledge. He answered that upon going home
just now to tea, from his work, his son Harry, who was in St. Peter&rsquo;s
School, told him of it, having been sent to do so by the master, Clerk
Jones. His son was with him, waiting to be questioned.</p>

<p>The boy came forward, very red and sheepish, looking as though he
thought he was going to be hung. He stammered and stuttered in
giving his answers to the coroner.</p>

<p>The tale he told was this. His name was Henry Dance, aged
thirteen. He was on the hill, not very far from St. Ann&rsquo;s Well, on
the Tuesday afternoon, looking about for Mark Ferrar. All on a
sudden he heard some quarrelling below him: somebody seemed to be
in a foaming passion, and little King the lame boy called out in a
fright, &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t! don&rsquo;t! you&rsquo;ll throw me over!&rdquo; Heard then a
sort of rustle of shrubs&mdash;as it sounded to him&mdash;and then heard the
steps of some one running away along the path below the upright bank.
Couldn&rsquo;t <em>see</em> anything of this; the bank prevented him; but did see
the arm of the boy who was running as he turned round the corner.
Didn&rsquo;t see the boy; only saw his left arm swaying; he had a green
handkerchief in his hand. Could not tell whether it was one of their
boys (St. Peter&rsquo;s) or one of the college boys; didn&rsquo;t see enough of him
for that. Didn&rsquo;t know then that anything bad had happened, and
thought no more about it at all; didn&rsquo;t hear of it till the next morning:
he had been in the first van that left Malvern, and went to bed as soon
as he got home.</p>

<p>The account was listened to breathlessly. The boy was in a regular
fright while he told it, but his tones and looks seemed honest and true.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you know it was King Sanker&rsquo;s voice you heard?&rdquo; asked
the coroner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, I didn&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;When I came to
hear of his fall the next day, I supposed it must ha&rsquo; been his. I didn&rsquo;t
know anybody had fell down; I didn&rsquo;t hear any cry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time in the afternoon was this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, I don&rsquo;t know exact. We had our tea at four: it wasn&rsquo;t
over-long after that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you recognize the other voice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. It was a boy&rsquo;s voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it one you had ever heard before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tell, sir; I wasn&rsquo;t near enough to hear or to catch the
words. King Sanker spoke last, just as I got over the spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You heard of the accident the next morning, you say. Did you
hear of it early?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was afore breakfast, sir. Some of our boys that waited for the
last van telled me; and Ferrar, he telled me. They said they had
helped to look for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then it came into your mind, that it was King Sanker you had
heard speak?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, it did. It come right into my mind, all sudden like, that
he might have been throwed over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well now, Mr. Harry Dance, how was it that you did not at once
hasten to report this? How is it that you have kept it in till now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry Dance looked too confused and frightened to answer. He
picked at the band of his grey cap and stood, first on one foot, then on
the other. The coroner pressed the question sharply, and he replied in
confusion.</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t like to tell it. Knew people were saying it might have been
one of their boys that had pitched him over. Was afraid to tell. Did
say a word to Mark Ferrar; not much: Ferrar wanted to know more,
and what it was he meant, but didn&rsquo;t tell him. That was yesterday
morning. Had felt uncomfortable ever since then, wanting to tell, but
not liking to. This afternoon, in school, writing their copies at the
desk, he had told Tom Wood&rsquo;art, the carpenter&rsquo;s son, who sat next
him; leastways, had said the college boy had not fell of himself, but
been pitched over; and Tom Wood&rsquo;art had made him tell it to another
boy, Collins; and then the two had went up to the desk and telled
their master, Mr. Jones; and Mr. Jones, after calling him up to ask
about it, had ordered him home to tell it all to his father; and his
father said he must come and tell it here.</p>

<p>The father, John Dance, spoke up again to confirm this, so far as his
part went. He was so anxious it should be told to the gentlemen at
once, he repeated, that he had come out all untidy as he was, not
stopping to put himself to rights in any way.</p>

<p>The next person to step forward was Mr. Jones, in his white cravat
and black clothes. He stated that the two boys, Thomas Woodward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
and James Collins, had made this strange communication to him.
Upon which he had questioned Dance, and at once despatched him
home to acquaint his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of a boy is Harry Dance, Mr. Jones?&rdquo; inquired the
coroner. &ldquo;A truthful boy?&mdash;one to be depended on? Some boys, as
I dare say you know, are capable of romancing in the most unaccountable
manner: inventing lies by the bushel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy is truthful, sir; a sufficiently good boy,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;Some of them are just what you describe; but Dance, so far as I
believe, may be relied upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, if this is to be credited, it must have been one of St.
Peter&rsquo;s boys who threw the deceased over,&rdquo; observed a juryman at the
other end. &ldquo;Did you do it yourself, Harry Dance? Stand straight,
and answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; I shouldn&rsquo;t never like to do such a cowardly thing,&rdquo; was
the answer, given with a rush of fear&mdash;if the look of his face might be
trusted. &ldquo;I was not anigh him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been one of you. This is the result of that fight you
two sets of boys held on Saturday. You have been harbouring malice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, I wasn&rsquo;t in the fight on Saturday. I had went over to
Clains on an errand for mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Clerk Jones. &ldquo;Dance was not in the fight at
all. As far as I can ascertain, there was no ill-feeling displayed on
either side at Malvern; no quarrelling of any kind.&rdquo; And Captain
Sanker, who was standing up to listen, confirmed this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The natural deduction to be drawn is, that if the deceased was
flung over, it was by one of St. Peter&rsquo;s boys&mdash;though the probability
is that he did not intend to inflict much injury,&rdquo; observed one of the
jury to the rest. &ldquo;Boys are so reprehensibly thoughtless. Come,
Harry Dance! if you did not give him a push yourself, you can tell, I
dare say, who did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Dance, with tears in his eyes, affirmed that he knew no more
than he had told: he had not the least notion who the boy was that
had been quarrelling with King. He saw none of the boys, St. Peter&rsquo;s
boys or college boys, about the hill at that time; though he was looking
out for them, because he wanted to find Ferrar: and he knew no more
than the dead what boy it was who had run away, for he saw nothing
but his arm and a green handkerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you find Ferrar after that?&rdquo; resumed the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; not long after. I found him looking for me round on
t&rsquo;other side of St. Ann&rsquo;s Well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way&mdash;on which side of St. Ann&rsquo;s Well is situated the spot
where you heard the quarrel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the right-hand side, sir, looking <em>down</em> the hill,&rdquo; said the boy.
And by the stress laid on the &ldquo;down&rdquo; I judged him to be given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
exactness. &ldquo;I know the place, sir. If you take a sideway path from
the Well bearing down&rsquo;ards, you come to it. It&rsquo;s shady and quiet
there; a place that nobody hardly finds out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you say anything to Ferrar, when you found him, of what
you had heard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. I didn&rsquo;t think any more about it. I didn&rsquo;t think any
harm had been done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you did mention it to Ferrar the next morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I had heard of it, then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only said I was afeard he might have been throwed over. Ferrar
asked me why, but I didn&rsquo;t like to say no more, for fear of doing mischief.
It wasn&rsquo;t me,&rdquo; added Dance, appealing piteously to the jury.
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have hurt a hair of his head: he was weak and lame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Ferrar here?&rdquo; cried the coroner. &ldquo;We must have him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ferrar was not there. And Mr. Jones, speaking up, said he had seen
nothing of Ferrar since the previous day. He was informed that he
had taken French leave to go off somewhere&mdash;which kind of leave, in
point of fact, he added, Master Ferrar was much in the habit of taking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where has he gone?&rdquo; cried the coroner. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean
he has decamped?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Decamped for the time being,&rdquo; said Mr. Jones. &ldquo;He will no doubt
put in an appearance in a day or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not one of the jury but pricked up his ears; not one, I could see it
in their faces, but was beginning to speculate on this absence of
Ferrar&rsquo;s. The coroner was staring straight before him, speculating too:
and just then Fred Sanker said something in a half-whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ferrar was with my brother King at the spot where he fell from.
As far as we know he was the last person who ever saw him alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And not here!&rdquo; cried the coroner. &ldquo;Why is he not? Where
does the neglect lie, I wonder? Gentlemen, I think we had better
send round for his father, and ask an explanation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a small town like Worcester (small in comparison with great
capitals) the inhabitants, rich and poor, mostly know one another, what
they are, and where their dwelling is. Old Ferrar lived within a stone&rsquo;s-throw
of the Angel; he was a china painter, employed by the Messrs.
Chamberlain. Some one ran for him; and he came; a tidy-looking
man in a good coat, with grey whiskers and grey hair. He bowed
civilly to the room, and gave his name as Thomas Ferrar.</p>

<p>As far as anything connected with what took place at Malvern he
was in total ignorance, he said. When his son Mark got home on the
Tuesday night, he had told him that Captain Sanker&rsquo;s little boy had
fallen down a part of the hill, and that he, Mark, had been one of those
who helped to find him. In the afternoon of the same day they heard
the little boy had died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your son?&rdquo; asked the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not sure where he is,&rdquo; replied Thomas Ferrar. &ldquo;When I
and his brother got home from the factory on Wednesday evening, my
daughter told me Mark had gone off again. Somebody had given him
half-a-crown, I believe. With that in his pocket, he was pretty sure to
go off on one of his rovings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is in the habit of going off, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, he has done it on occasion almost ever since he could run
alone. I used to leather him well for it, but it was of no use; it didn&rsquo;t
stop it. It&rsquo;s his only fault. Barring that, he&rsquo;s as good and upright
a lad as anybody need have. He does not go off for the purpose of
doing harm: neither does he get into any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where does he go to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always to one of two places; to South Crabb, or to his grandfather&rsquo;s
at Pinvin. It&rsquo;s generally to South Crabb, to see the Batleys,
who are cousins of my late wife&rsquo;s. They&rsquo;ve boys and girls of Mark&rsquo;s
own age, and he likes to be there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You conclude, then, that he is at one of these places now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure to be, sir; and I think it&rsquo;s sure to be South Crabb. He was
at Pinvin a fortnight ago; for I walked over on the Sunday morning and
took him with me. Mark is of a roving turn; he is always talking of
wanting to see the world. I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;ll ever settle down to
steady work at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we want him here, Mr. Ferrar; and must have him too.
Could you send after him&mdash;and get him here by to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can send his brother after him, if you say it must be. The likelihood
is that he will come home of himself to-morrow evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, but we must have him here in the afternoon, you see. We
want to hear what he can tell us about the deceased. It is thought
that he was the last person with him before the fall. And, gentlemen,&rdquo;
added the coroner, turning to the jury, &ldquo;I will adjourn proceedings to
the same hour to-morrow&mdash;three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the inquest was adjourned accordingly, and the room slowly
cleared itself. Very slowly. People stood in groups of threes and
fours to talk to each other. This new evidence was startling: and the
impression it made was, that one of the Frogs had certainly thrown
King down.</p>

<p>The green handkerchief was mentioned. Coloured silk pocket-handkerchiefs
were much patronized by gentlemen then, and the one used
by Dr. Teal that day happened to be green. The doctor said he had
missed his handkerchief when they were down at the Abbey before tea,
but could not tell where he had left it. He found it in the room at St.
Ann&rsquo;s when they got up again, and supposed it had been there all
along. So that handkerchief was not much thought of: especially as
several of the Frogs had green neckerchiefs on, and might have taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
them off, as it was very hot. That a Frog had flung King over,
appeared to be, to use the coroner&rsquo;s words on another part of the
subject, as plain as a turnpike. The Sankers, one and all, adopted it
as conclusive; Captain Sanker in particular was nearly wild, and said
bitter things of the Frogs. Poor King still lay in the same room, and
none of them, as before, cared to go by the door.</p>

<p>It must have been in the middle of the night. Anyway, it looked
pitch-dark. I was asleep, and dreaming that we were sorting handkerchiefs:
all colours seemed to be there but a green one, and that&mdash;the
one being looked for&mdash;we could not find: when something suddenly
woke me. A hand was grasping at my shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halloa! who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Johnny, I can&rsquo;t stop in my bed; I&rsquo;ve come to yours. If you
mind my getting in, I&rsquo;ll lie across the foot, and get to sleep that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice was Dan&rsquo;s, and it had no end of horror in it. He was
standing by the bed in his night-shirt, shivering. And yet the summer&rsquo;s
night was hot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get in, if you like, Dan: there&rsquo;s plenty of room. What&rsquo;s the matter
with your own bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;King&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; he said, in a dreadful whisper, as he crept trembling in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;King! Why, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He comes in and lies down in his place just as he used to lie,&rdquo;
shivered Dan. &ldquo;I asked Toby to sleep with me to-night, and Fred
wouldn&rsquo;t let him. Fred ought to be ashamed; it&rsquo;s all his ill-nature.
He&rsquo;s bigger than I am, one of the seniors, and he never cares whether
he sleeps alone or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Dan, you should not get these fancies into your head about
King. You know it&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you it is true. King&rsquo;s there. First of all, he stood at the
foot of the bed and looked at me; and then, when I hid my face, I
found he had got into it. He&rsquo;s lying there, just as he used to lie, his
face turned to the wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To begin with, you couldn&rsquo;t see him&mdash;him, or any one else. It&rsquo;s
too dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not dark. My room&rsquo;s lighter than this; it has a bigger window:
and the sky was bright and the stars were out. Anyway, Johnny, it
was light enough to see King&mdash;and there he was. Do you think I&rsquo;d
tell a lie over it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say I felt very comfortable myself. It&rsquo;s not pleasant to be
woke up with this kind of thing at the top of a house when somebody&rsquo;s
lying dead underneath. Dan&rsquo;s voice was enough to give one the shivers,
let alone his words. Some stars came out, and I could see the outline
of the furniture: or perhaps the stars had been shining all along; only,
on first awaking, the eye is not accustomed to the darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try and go to sleep, Dan. You&rsquo;ll be all right in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>To go to sleep seemed, however, to be far enough from Dan&rsquo;s
thoughts. After a bit of uneasy turning and trembling&mdash;and I&rsquo;m sure
any one would have said his legs had caught St. Vitus&rsquo;s dance&mdash;he
gave sleep up as a bad job, and broke out now and again with all sorts
of detached comments. I could only lie and listen.</p>

<p>Wondered whether he should be seeing King always?&mdash;if so, would
rather be dead. Wished he had not gone to sleep on that confounded
bench outside St. Ann&rsquo;s Well&mdash;might have been at hand near King,
and saved him, if he had not. It was that beastly bottled ale that
made him. Wished bottled ale had not been invented. Wished he
could wring Dance&rsquo;s neck&mdash;or Ferrar&rsquo;s&mdash;or that Wood&rsquo;arts, whichever
of the lot it was that had struck King. Knew it was one of the three.
What on earth could have taken the Frogs to Malvern that day?&mdash;Wished
every Frog ever born was hanged or drowned. Thought it
must be Ferrar&mdash;else why had the fellow decamped? Thought the
whole boiling of Frogs should be driven from the town&mdash;how dared
they, the insolent charity beggars, have their school near the college
school? Wondered what would be done to Ferrar if it was proved
against him? Wished it had been Ferrar to fall down in place of
King. Wished it had been himself (Dan) rather than King. Poor
King!&mdash;who was always so gentle&mdash;and never gave offence to any of
them&mdash;and was so happy with his hymns and his fancies, and his
poetry!&mdash;and had said &ldquo;Lord Bateman&rdquo; for them that day when told
to say it, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At this thought Dan broke fairly down and sobbed as though his
heart were breaking. I felt uncommonly sorry for him; he had been
very fond of King; and I was sorry for his superstition. What a
mistake it seemed for Mrs. Sanker to have allowed them to grow up
in it.</p>

<p>At three o&rsquo;clock the next day the inquest met again. The coroner
and jury, who seemed to have got thoroughly interested in the case
now, kept their time to a minute. There was much stir in the neighbourhood,
and the street was full before the Angel Inn. As to Frog
Lane, it was said the excitement there had never been equalled. The
report that it was one of St. Peter&rsquo;s boys who had done it, went echoing
everywhere; no one thought of doubting it. <em>I</em> did not. Watching
Harry Dance&rsquo;s face when he had given his evidence, I felt sure that
every word he said was true. Some one <em>had</em> flung King over: and
that some one, there could be no question of it, was one of those
common adversaries, the Frogs. If King must have gone to sleep that
afternoon, better that Dan, as he had said, or one of the rest of us, had
stayed by to protect him!</p>

<p>Mark Ferrar had turned up. His brother found him at South Crabb.
He came to the inquest in his best clothes, those he had worn at
Malvern. I noticed then, but I had not remembered it, that he had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
grass-green neckerchief on, tied with a large bow and ends. His good-natured,
ugly, honest face was redder than ever as he stood to give his
evidence. He did not show any of the stammering confusion that
Dance had done, but spoke out with modest self-possession.</p>

<p>His name was Mark Ferrar, aged nearly fourteen (and looking ever
so much older), second son of Thomas Ferrar, china painter. He had
seen the deceased boy, King Sanker, at Malvern on Tuesday. When
he and some more of St. Peter&rsquo;s boys were coming down the hill they
had met King and his party. King spoke to him and told his father,
Captain Sanker, that he was the Frog&mdash;the college boys called them
Frogs&mdash;who had picked him up out of the fight on Saturday to save
him from being crushed: and Captain Sanker thanked him and gave
him half-a-crown to spend in Malvern cakes. Master Johnny Ludlow
was with the Sankers, and saw and heard this. Did not buy the
Malvern cakes: had meant to, and treat the rest of the boys; but
dinner was ready near the foot of the hill when they got down, and
forgot it afterwards. After dinner he and a lot more boys went up
another of the beacons and down on the Herefordshire side. They got
back about four o&rsquo;clock, and had bread-and-butter and cider for tea.
Then he and Harry Dance went up the hill again, taking two ways, to
see which would be at St. Ann&rsquo;s Well first. Couldn&rsquo;t see Dance when
he got up, thought he might be hiding, and went looking about for him.
Went along a side-path leading off from St. Ann&rsquo;s; &rsquo;twas sheltered,
and thought Dance might be there. Suddenly heard himself called to:
looked onwards, and saw the lame boy, King Sanker, there, and some
chairs and glasses on a table. Went on, and King asked him to sit down,
and began talking to him, saying he had had to say &ldquo;Lord Bateman&rdquo;
before them all. He, Ferrar, did not know what &ldquo;Lord Bateman&rdquo;
was, and King said he would say it to him. Began to say it; found it
was poetry verses: King had said a good many when he broke off in
the middle of one, and told him to go then, for they were coming. Did
not know who &ldquo;they&rdquo; meant, did not see or hear anybody himself;
but went away accordingly. Went looking all about for Dance again;
found him by-and-by on a kind of plateau on the other side of St. Ann&rsquo;s.
They went up the hill together, and only got down again when it was
time to start for Worcester. He did not go in the first van; there was
no room; waited for the second. Saw the other party starting: heard
that some one was missing: found it was King; offered to help to look
for him. Was going up with the rest past the Unicorn, when some
people met them, saying they&rsquo;d heard groans. Ran on, and found it
was King Sanker. He seemed to have fallen right down from the place
where he had been sitting in the afternoon, and where he, Ferrar, had
left him.</p>

<p>Such in substance was the evidence he gave. Some of it I could
corroborate, and did. I told of King&rsquo;s asking that Ferrar might go up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
to him the next day, and of his promising him &ldquo;Lord Bateman,&rdquo; which
he had got by him, written out.</p>

<p>But Ferrar was not done with. Important questions had to be asked
him yet. Sometimes it was the coroner who put them, sometimes one
or other of the jury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see anything at all of the deceased after leaving him as
you have described, Mark Ferrar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. I never saw him again till night, when we found him
lying under a part of the hill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you quitted him at his bidding, did you see any boys about,
either college boys or St. Peter&rsquo;s boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I did not see any; not one. The hills about there seemed
as lonely as could be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which way did you take when you left him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ran straight past St. Ann&rsquo;s, and got on to the part that divides
the Worcestershire beacon from the next. Waiting for Dance, I sat
down on the slope, and looked at Worcester for a bit, trying how much
of the town I could make out, and how many of the churches, and that.
As I was going back toward St. Ann&rsquo;s I met Dance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did Dance say to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said he had been hunting for me, and wanted to know where I
had hid myself, and I said I had been hunting for him. We went on
up the hill then and met some more of our boys; and we stayed all
together till it was time to go down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Dance say that he had heard sounds of quarrelling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, never a word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What communication did Dance make to you on the subject the
following morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing certain, sir. Dance went home in the first van, and he
didn&rsquo;t hear about King Sanker till the morning. I was saying then
how we found him, and that he must have fell straight off from the
place above. Dance stopped me, and said was it sure that he fell&mdash;was
it sure he had not been pushed off? I asked why he said that, but he
wouldn&rsquo;t answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he refuse to answer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I kept asking him to tell me, but he just said it was only a fancy
that came to him. He had interrupted so eager like, that I thought he
must have heard something. Later, I asked Master Johnny Ludlow
whether the boy had been pushed off, but he said no. I couldn&rsquo;t get it
out of my head, however.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What clothes did you wear, witness, that day at Malvern?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These here that I&rsquo;ve got on now, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you wear that same green neckerchief?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. My sister Sally bought it new for me to go in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you take it off at Malvern?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. Some of them took their handkerchers off at dinner,
because it was hot, but I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the first time Ferrar hesitated. His face turned scarlet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, speak up. The truth, mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sally had told me not to mess my new silk handkercher, for I
wasn&rsquo;t likely to have another of one while; and I thought if I got
untying and re-tying of it, I should mess it.&rdquo; It seemed quite a task to
Ferrar to confess this. He feared the boys would laugh at him. But I
think no one doubted that it was the true reason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not take it off while you were sitting with the deceased?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. I never took it off all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it off now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mark Ferrar looked too surprised to understand the order, and did
nothing. The coroner repeated it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take off this here handkercher, sir? Now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. The jury wish to see it open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mark untied the bow and pulled it off, his very freckles showing out
red. It was a three-cornered silk neckerchief, as green as grass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was this like the kerchief you saw being swung about, Harry
Dance?&rdquo; asked the coroner, holding it up, and then letting it drop on
the table.</p>

<p>Harry Dance gazed at it as it lay, and shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think it were the one, sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you think it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That there looks smaller and brighter, and t&rsquo;other was bigger and
darker. Leastways, I think it were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it more like this?&rdquo; interrupted Dr. Teal, shaking out his
handkerchief from his pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. It seemed like a big handkerchief, and was
about that there colour o&rsquo; your&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some inquiry was made at this point as to the neckerchiefs worn by
the other boys. It turned out that two or three had worn very large
ones, something the colour of Dr. Teal&rsquo;s. So that passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One word, Harry Dance. Did you see Ferrar with his handkerchief
off that day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice, sir: I don&rsquo;t remember. Some of us took &rsquo;em off on
the hills&mdash;&rsquo;twas very hot&mdash;and never put &rsquo;em on again all day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The coroner and jury talked together, and then Harry Dance was
told to repeat the evidence he had given the day before. He went over
it again: the sounds of quarrelling, and the words in the voice he
had supposed to be King&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t! you&rsquo;ll throw me
over.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Had Ferrar his neckerchief on when you met him soon after this?&rdquo;
questioned Captain Chamberlain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he had, sir. I think if he had not I should ha&rsquo; noticed it.
I&rsquo;m nearly as sure as I can be that it wasn&rsquo;t off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Dance was done with, Mark Ferrar was begun upon again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What induced you to go off from your home on Wednesday evening
without notice?&rdquo; asked the coroner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went to South Crabb, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask you where you went, I ask why you went?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I go over there sometimes, sir. I told Sally I was going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand my question? <em>Why</em> did you go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing particular made me go, sir. Only that I had got some
money; and I was feeling so sorry that the little lame boy was dead, I
couldn&rsquo;t bear to be still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been punished often, Mark Ferrar, for going off on these
expeditions?&rdquo; cried one of the jury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used to be, sir. Father has leathered me for it at home, and
Clerk Jones at school. I can&rsquo;t do without going out a bit. I wish I
was a sailor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed! Well&mdash;is there one of your companions that you can
suspect of having harmed this poor little boy&mdash;accidentally or otherwise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir. It is being said that he was pushed over in ill-feeling, or
else by accident; but it don&rsquo;t seem likely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you push him over yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; returned Ferrar, in surprise. &ldquo;Me push him over!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As far as we can learn yet, no one was with him there but you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have saved him from it, sir, if I had been there, instead of
harming him. When he sent me away he was all right, and not sitting
anigh the edge. If it was me that had done it, sir, he&rsquo;d not have asked
for me to go up to him in his room&mdash;and shook hands&mdash;and said I
should see him in heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mark Ferrar broke down at the remembrance, and sobbed like a
child. I don&rsquo;t think one single person present thought it was he,
especially the coroner and jury. But the question was&mdash;which of the
other boys could it have been?</p>

<p>Several of them were called before the coroner. One and all declared
they had done no harm to the deceased&mdash;had not been near him to do
it&mdash;would not have done it if they had been&mdash;did not know he had been
sitting in the place talked of&mdash;did not (most of them) know where the
spot was now. In short, they denied it utterly.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones stepped forward then. He told the coroner and jury that
he had done his best to come to the bottom of the affair, but could not
find out anything. He did not believe one of his boys had been in it;
they were mischievous enough, as he well knew, and sometimes deceitful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
enough; but they all seemed to be, and he honestly believed <em>were</em>,
innocent of this.</p>

<p>The room was cleared while the jury deliberated. Their verdict
was to the effect that Kingsley Sanker had died from falling over a
portion of one of the Malvern hills; but whether the fall was caused
by accident, or not, there was not sufficient evidence to show.</p>

<p>It was late when it was over. Growing dusk. In turning out of the
inn passage to the street, I remember the great buzz around, and the
people pushing one&rsquo;s elbows; and I can&rsquo;t remember much more. If
one Frog was there, it seemed to me that there were hundreds.</p>

<p>I stayed at Captain Sanker&rsquo;s again that night. We all went up to
bed after supper and prayers&mdash;which the captain read. He said he
could not divest himself of the idea that it was a pure accident&mdash;for
who would be likely to harm a helpless lad?&mdash;and that what Dance
heard must have been some passing dispute connected with other
people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along, Johnny: this one candle&rsquo;ll do for us both,&rdquo; cried Dan,
taking up a bed candlestick and waiting for me to follow him.</p>

<p>I kept close to him as we went by the room&mdash;<em>the</em> room, you know&mdash;for
Dan was worse than any of them for passing it. He and King had
been much together. King followed him in age; they had always
slept together and gone to school together; the rest were older or
younger&mdash;and naturally Dan felt it most.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be a minute, Johnny, and then you can take the candle,&rdquo;
said he, when we got to the top. &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before I had well turned round, after getting in, I declare Dan had
rushed all his things off in a heap and leaped into bed. Poor King
used not to be so quick, and Dan always made him put the light out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Dan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Johnny. I hope I shall get to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put his head under the bedclothes as I went away with the
candle. I was not long getting into bed either. The stars were bright
in the sky.</p>

<p>Before there was time to get to sleep, Dan came bursting in, shivering
as on the past night, and asking to be let get into the bed. I did not
mind his being in the bed&mdash;liked it rather, for company&mdash;but I did think
it a great stupid pity that he should be giving way to these superstitious
fears as though he were a girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Dan: I should be above it. One of the smallest of those
Frogs couldn&rsquo;t show out more silly than this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in my bed again, Johnny. Lying down. I can&rsquo;t sleep there
another night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know that he is below in his coffin&mdash;with the room-door
locked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care&mdash;he&rsquo;s there in the bed. You had no sooner gone with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
the light than King crept in and lay down beside me. He used to have
a way of putting his left arm over me outside the clothes, and he put it
so to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you he did. Nobody would believe it, but he did. I felt it
like a weight. It was heavy, just as dead arms are. Johnny, if this
goes on, I shall die. Have you heard what mamma says?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She says <em>she</em> saw King last night. She couldn&rsquo;t sleep; and by-and-by,
happening to look out of bed, she saw him standing there. He was
looking very solemn, and did not speak. She turned to awake papa, in
spite of the way he goes on ridiculing such things, but when she looked
next King had gone. I wish he was buried, Johnny; I shouldn&rsquo;t think
he could come back into the house then. Should you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not in it now&mdash;in that sense. It&rsquo;s all imagination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it! I should like you to have been in my bed, instead of me;
you&rsquo;d have seen whether it was imagination or not. Do you suppose
his heavy arm across me was fancy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he does not come in here. Let us go to sleep. Good-night,
Dan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dan lay still for a good bit, and I was nearly asleep when he awoke
me sobbing. His face was turned the other way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d kill me, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kill you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to live any longer without King. It is so lonely.
There&rsquo;s nobody now. Fred&rsquo;s getting to be almost a man, and Toby&rsquo;s
a little duffer. King was best. I&rsquo;ve many a time snubbed him and
boxed him, and I always put upon him; and&mdash;and now he&rsquo;s gone. I
wish I had fallen down instead of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get over it, Dan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. But it&rsquo;s such a thing to get over. And the time goes so
slowly. I wish it was this time next year!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what some of the doctors say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo; returned Dan, putting the tip of his nose out
of bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Teal told Captain Sanker of it; I was by and heard him. They
think that poor King would not have lived above another year, or so:
that there was no chance of his living to grow up. So you might have
lost him soon in any case, Dan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;d have been here till then; he wouldn&rsquo;t have died through
falling down Malvern Hill. Oh, and to think that I was rough with
him often!&mdash;and didn&rsquo;t try to help him when he wanted it! and laughed
at his poetry! Johnny, I wish you&rsquo;d kill me! I wish it had been me
to fall over instead of him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was not one of them that felt it as keenly as Dan did: but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
chances were that he would forget King the soonest. Dan was of that
impetuous warm nature that&rsquo;s all fire at first; and all forgetfulness when
the fire goes out.</p>

<p>I went home the next day to Crabb Cot. Mr. Coney came into
Worcester to attend the corn-market, and offered to drive me back in
his gig. So I took my leave of the Sankers, and my last look at poor
King in his coffin. He was to be buried on Monday in St. Peter&rsquo;s
churchyard.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>The next news we had from Worcester was that Mark Ferrar had
gone to sea. His people had wanted him to take up some trade at
home; but Mark said he was not going to stay there to be told every
day of his life that he killed King Sanker. For some of the Frogs had
taken up the notion that it must have been he&mdash;why else, they asked,
did the coroner and the rest of &rsquo;em want to see his green handkercher
shook out? So his father, who was just as much hurt at the aspersions
as Mark, allowed him to have his way and go to sea; in spite of
Sally crying her eyes out, and foretelling that he would come home
drowned. Mark was sent to London to some friend, who undertook to
make the necessary arrangements; he was bound apprentice to the
sea, and shipped off in a trading vessel sailing for Spain.</p>

<p>It was Michaelmas when we next went in to Worcester (save for a
day at the festival), driving in from Dyke Manor: the Squire, Mrs.
Todhetley, and I. You have heard the expedition mentioned before,
for it was the one when we hired the dairymaid, Grizzel, at St. John&rsquo;s
mop. That business over, we went down to Captain Sanker&rsquo;s and
found them at home.</p>

<p>They were all getting pretty well over the death now, except Dan.
Dan&rsquo;s grief and nervousness were as bad as ever. Worse, even. Captain
and Mrs. Sanker enlarged upon it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dan grieves after his brother dreadfully: they were always companions,
you see,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;He has foolish fancies also:
thinks he sees King continually. We have had to put him to sleep
with Fred downstairs, for nothing would persuade him that King, poor
fellow, did not come and get into his old place in bed. The night the
poor lad was buried, Dan startled the whole house up; he flew down
the stairs crying and shrieking, and saying that King was there. We
don&rsquo;t know what to do: he seems to get worse, rather than better.
Did you notice how thin he has become? You saw him as you
came in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like a bag of bones,&rdquo; said the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay. Some days he is so nervous and ill he can&rsquo;t go to school.
I never knew such a thing, for my part. I was for trying flogging, but
his mother wouldn&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;do you mean to tell us, Sanker, that he fancies he sees King&rsquo;s
<em>ghost</em>?&rdquo; cried the Squire, in great amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose so,&rdquo; answered the captain. &ldquo;He fancies he sees
<em>him</em>: and poor King, as far as this world&rsquo;s concerned, can be nothing
but a ghost now. The other evening, when Dan had been commanded
to the head-master&rsquo;s house for something connected with the studies
and detained till after dark, he came rushing in with a white face and
his hair all wet, saying he had met King under the elm-trees, as he was
running back through the green towards Edgar Tower. How can you
deal with such a case?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say flogging would be as good as anything,&rdquo; said the
Squire, decidedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I thought at first. He&rsquo;s too ill for it now. There&rsquo;s nothing,
hardly, left of him to flog.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Sanker, there is only one thing for you to do,&rdquo; put in Mrs.
Todhetley. &ldquo;And that is, consult a clever medical man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear lady, we have taken him to pretty nearly all the
medical men in Worcester,&rdquo; cried the captain. &ldquo;He goes regularly to
Dr. Hastings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what do the doctors say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They think that the catastrophe of King&rsquo;s unhappy death has seized
upon the lad&rsquo;s mind, and brought on a sort of hypochondriacal affection.
One of them said it was what the French would call a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maladie des nerfs</i>.
Dan seems so full of self-reproach, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, for not having made more of King when he was living. And
also, I think, for having suffered himself to fall asleep that afternoon on
the bench outside the Well: he says had he kept awake he might have
been with King, and so saved him. But, as I tell Dan, there&rsquo;s nothing
to reproach himself with in that: he could not foresee that King would
meet with the accident. The doctors say now that he must have
change of air, and be got away altogether. They recommend the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sea! Do you mean sea-air?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; the sea itself; a voyage: and Dan&rsquo;s wild to go. A less complete
change than that, they think, will be of little avail, for his illness
borders almost&mdash;almost upon lunacy. I&rsquo;m sure, what with one thing
and another, we seem to be in for a peck of misfortunes,&rdquo; added the
captain, rumpling his hair helplessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And shall you let him go to sea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. I stood out against it at first. Never meant
to send a son of mine to sea; that has always been my resolution.
Look at what I had to starve upon for ever so many years&mdash;a lieutenant&rsquo;s
half-pay&mdash;and to keep my wife and bring up my children upon
it! You can&rsquo;t imagine it, Squire; it&rsquo;s cruel. Dan&rsquo;s too old for the
navy, however; and, if he does go, it must be into the merchant service.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
I don&rsquo;t like that, either; we regular sailors never do like it, we hold
ourselves above it; but there&rsquo;s a better chance of getting on in it and
of making money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I am very sorry for it altogether,&rdquo; said Mrs. Todhetley.
&ldquo;A sailor cannot have any comfort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I expect he&rsquo;ll have to go,&rdquo; said the captain, ruefully: &ldquo;he must get
these ideas out of his head. It&rsquo;s such a thing, you see, for him to be
always fancying he sees King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a dreadful thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wife had a brother once who was always seeing odd colours
wherever he looked: colours and shadows and things. But that was
not as bad as this. His doctor called it nerves: and I conclude Dan
takes after him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, I think Dan takes after your side, not mine,&rdquo; calmly put
in Mrs Sanker, who had her light hair flowing and something black in
it that looked like a feather. &ldquo;He is so very passionate, you know: and
I could not go into a passion if I tried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose he takes after us both,&rdquo; returned Captain Sanker. &ldquo;I
know he never got his superstitious fancies from me, or from any one
belonging to me. We may be of a passionate nature, we Sankers, but
we don&rsquo;t see ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a week or two&rsquo;s time after that, Dan was off to sea. A large
shipping firm, trading from London to India, took him as midshipman.
The ship was called the <cite>Bangalore</cite>; a fine vessel of about fourteen
hundred tons, bound for some port out there. When Captain Sanker
came back from shipping him off, he was full of spirits, and said Dan
was cured already. No sooner was Dan amidst the bustle of London,
than his fears and fancies left him.</p>

<p>It was some time in the course of the next spring&mdash;getting on for
summer, I think&mdash;that Captain Sanker gave up his house in Worcester,
and went abroad, somewhere into Germany. Partly from motives of
economy, for they had no idea of saving, and somehow spent more
than their income; partly to see if change would get up Mrs. Sanker&rsquo;s
health, which was failing. After that, we heard nothing more of them:
and a year or two went on.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, here&rsquo;s a young man asking to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A young man asking to see me,&rdquo; cried the Squire&mdash;we were just
finishing dinner. &ldquo;Who is it, Thomas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; replied old Thomas. &ldquo;Some smart young fellow
dressed as a sailor. I&rsquo;ve showed him into your room, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go and see who it is, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was summer-time, and we were at home at Dyke Manor. I went
on to the little square room. You have been in it too. Opposite the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Squire&rsquo;s old bureau and underneath the map of Warwickshire on the
wall, sat the sailor. He had good blue clothes on and a turned-down
white collar, and held a straw hat in his hand. Where had I seen the
face? A very red-brown honest face, with a mouth as wide as Molly&rsquo;s
rolling-pin. Wider, now that it was smiling.</p>

<p>He stood up, and turned his straw hat about a little nervously.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve forgotten me, Master Johnny. Mark Ferrar, please, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mark Ferrar it was, looking shorter and broader; and I put out my
hand to him. I take my likes and dislikes, as you have already heard,
and can&rsquo;t help taking them; and Ferrar was one whom I had always
liked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, I&rsquo;ve made bold to come over here,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;Captain Sanker&rsquo;s left Worcester, they tell me, and I can&rsquo;t hear where
he is to be found: and the Teals, they have left. I&rsquo;ve brought news
to him from his son, Mr. Dan: and father said I had better come over
here and tell it, and maybe Squire Todhetley might get it sent to the
captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen anything of Mr. Dan, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been with him nearly all the time, Master Johnny. We
served on the same ship: he as middy and I as working apprentice.
Not but what the middies are apprenticed just as sure as we are.
They don&rsquo;t do our rough work, the cleaning and that, and they mess
apart; but that&rsquo;s pretty nigh all the difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how are you getting on, Mark?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First-rate, sir. The captain and officers are satisfied with me, and
when I&rsquo;ve served my four years I shall go up to pass for second mate.
I try to improve myself a bit in general learning at odd moments too,
sir, seeing I didn&rsquo;t have much. It may be of use to me if I ever get
up a bit in life. Mr. Dan&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But look here, Ferrar,&rdquo; I interrupted, the recollection striking me.
&ldquo;How came you and Mr. Dan to sail together? You were on a small
home-coasting barque: he went in an Indiaman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was in the barque first of all, Master Johnny, and took a voyage
to Spain and back. But our owners, hearing a good report of me, that
I was likely to make a smart and steady sailor, put me on their big
ship, the <cite>Bangalore</cite>. In a day or two Mr. Dan Sanker came on board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how is he getting on? Does he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, Master Johnny, I&rsquo;d like to tell what I&rsquo;ve got to tell
about him to the Squire,&rdquo; he interrupted. &ldquo;It is for that, sir, I have
come all the way over here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I called the Squire in. The following was the condensed substance
of Ferrar&rsquo;s narrative. What with his way of telling it, and what with
the Squire&rsquo;s interruptions, it was rather long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dan joined the <cite>Bangalore</cite> the day we sailed, sir. When he
saw me as one of the sailors he started back as if I shocked him. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
in a week or two, when he had got round from his sea-sickness, he
grew friendly, and sometimes talked a bit. I used to bring up Master
King&rsquo;s death, and say how sorry I was for it&mdash;for you see, sir, I
couldn&rsquo;t bear that he should think it true that I had had a hand in it.
But he seemed to hate the subject; he&rsquo;d walk away if I began it, and
at last he said he couldn&rsquo;t stand the talking about King; so I let it be.
Our voyage was a long one, for the ship went about from port to port.
Mr. Dan&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of a sailor did he make?&rdquo; interrupted the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, he was a good smart sailor at his work, but he got to be
looked upon as rather a queer kind of young man. He couldn&rsquo;t bear
to keep his night watches&mdash;it was too lonely, he said; and several
times he fell into trouble for calling up the hands when there was
nothing to call them up for. At Hong Kong he had a fever, and they
shaved his head; but he got well again. One evening, after we had
left Hong Kong and were on our way to San Francisco, I was on deck&mdash;almost
dark it was&mdash;when Mr. Dan comes down the rigging all in a
heap, just as if a wild-cat was after him. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s King up there,&rsquo; he
says to me: and Mr. Conroy, do what he would, couldn&rsquo;t get him up
again. After that he went about the ship peeping and peering, always
fancying King was hiding somewhere and going to pounce out upon
him. The captain said his fever was coming back: Mr. Dan said it
was not fever, it was King. I told him one day what I thought&mdash;that
Master King had been flung down; that it was not an accident&mdash;I felt
as sure of it as though I had seen it done; and what I said seemed to
put him up, sir. Who did I fancy had done it, or would do it? he
asked me all in anger: and I said I did not know who, but if ever I
got back to Worcester I&rsquo;d leave not a stone unturned to find out. Well,
sir, he got worse: worse in his fancies, and worse as to sickness. He
was seeing King always at night, and he had dysentery and ague, and
grew so weak that he could hardly stand. One of the cabin-boys took
sick and died on board. The night he lay below, dead, Mr. Dan burst
into the saloon saying it was King who was below, and that he&rsquo;d never
be got out of the ship again. Mr. Conroy&mdash;he was the chief mate, sir&mdash;humoured
him, telling him not to fear, that if it was King he would
be buried deep in the sea on the morrow: but Mr. Dan said he&rsquo;d not
stop in the sea, any more than he had stopped in his grave in St. Peter&rsquo;s
churchyard at home; he&rsquo;d be back in the ship again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dan Sanker must have been mad,&rdquo; observed the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I think he was; leastways not right. In a day or two he
had to be fastened down in his berth with brain-fever, and Mr. Conroy
said that as he had known me in the past days I had better be the one
to sit with him, for he couldn&rsquo;t be left. I was quite taken aback to
hear what he said in his mutterings, and hoped it wasn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he get well again?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Just for a day or two, sir. The fever left him, but he was in the
shockingest state of weakness you could imagine. The night before
he died&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire started up. &ldquo;Dan Sanker&rsquo;s not dead, Ferrar!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes he is, sir. It&rsquo;s what I have come to tell of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness bless me! Poor Dan dead! Only think of it, Johnny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I was not surprised. From the moment Ferrar first spoke, an
instinct had been upon me that it was so. He resumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything was done for him that could be, sir. We had a doctor
on board&mdash;a passenger going to California&mdash;but he could not save him.
He said when it came to such awful weakness as that, there could be
no saving. Mr. Conroy and the other officers were very kind to him&mdash;the
skipper too; but they could do nothing. All his fears seemed to
be gone then; we could hardly hear his whispers, but he was sensible
and calm. He said he knew God had forgave him for what he did,
and would blot his sin out, and King had forgave him too, and had
come to tell him so: he had been to him in the night and talked and
smiled happily and said over to him a verse of &lsquo;Lord Bateman&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you say he was in his senses, Ferrar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, that he was. That night he made a confession, Mr.
Conroy and the doctor and me being by him. It was he that killed
King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless my heart!&rdquo; cried the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had seen me sitting with King that afternoon at Malvern, and
heard him saying the verses to me. It put his temper up frightful, sir,
I being one of their enemies the Frogs; but he says if he&rsquo;d known it
was me that snatched King out of the fight on Saturday, he&rsquo;d not have
minded so much. It must have been him that King saw coming,
Master Johnny,&rdquo; added Ferrar, turning momentarily from the Squire
to address me; &ldquo;when he broke off in the midst of &lsquo;Lord Bateman,&rsquo;
and told me, all in a hurry, to go away. He waited till I was gone,
and then rushed on to King and began abusing him and knocking him
about. King was unsteady through his weak leg, and one of the
knocks sent him over the bank. Dan says he was frightened almost
to death; he caught up Dr. Teal&rsquo;s green handkercher from a chair and
ran to the Well with it; he was too frightened to go and see after
King, thinking he had killed him; and he sat down outside the Well
and made as if he went to sleep. He never meant to hurt King,
he said; it was only passion; but he had drunk a lot of strong
ale and some wine upon it, and hardly knew what he was about. He
said there was never a minute since but what he had been sorry for it,
and he had been always seeing King. He asked me to show him the
verses that had been given to me, that King wrote out, &lsquo;Lord
Bateman&rsquo;&mdash;for I had got them with me at sea, sir&mdash;and he kissed
them and held them to him till he died.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear!&rdquo; sighed the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all, sir,&rdquo; concluded Ferrar. &ldquo;Mr. Conroy wrote out a
copy of his confession, which I brought along with me to Worcester.
Mr. Dan charged me to tell his father, and my own folks, and any
other friends I liked that had thought me guilty, and I promised him.
He was as placid as a child all the day after that, and died at sundown,
so happy and peaceful that it was almost like heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ferrar broke off with a sob. Poor Dan!</p>

<p>And that was the final ending of the Day of Pleasure. He and
King are together again.</p>

MARGARET RYMER.</h2>


<p>They had gone through the snow to evening service at North Crabb,
the Squire, Mrs. Todhetley, and Tod, leaving me at home with one of
my splitting headaches. Thomas had come in to ask if I would have
the lamp, but I told him I would rather be without it. So there I sat
on alone, beside the fire, listening to Hannah putting the children to
bed upstairs, and looking sleepily out at the snowy landscape.</p>

<p>As the fire became dim, sending the room into gloom, the light
outside grew stronger. The moon was high; clear and bright as
crystal; what with that, and the perfectly white snow that lay on
everything, the night seemed nearly as light as day. The grass plat
outside was a smooth white plain, the clustering shrubs beyond it being
also white.</p>

<p>I knew the fire wanted replenishing: I knew that if I sat on much
longer, I should fall asleep; but sit on I did, letting the fire go, too
listless to move. My eyes were fixed dreamily on the plain of snow,
with the still moonlight lying across it. The room grew darker, the
landscape lighter.</p>

<p>And asleep, in another minute, I should inevitably have been, but
for a circumstance that suddenly arose. All in a moment&mdash;I saw not
how or whence it came&mdash;a dark figure appeared on the grass plat, close
before the bank of shrubs, right in front of me; the figure of a man,
wrapped in a big great-coat. He was standing still and gazing fixedly
at the house. Gazing, as it seemed (though that was impossible) at
<em>me</em>. I was wide awake at once, and sitting bolt upright in the chair.</p>

<p>Yes, there could be no mistake; and it was no delusion. The man
appeared to be a tall man, strong and muscular, with a mass of hair on
his face. What could he want? Was it a robber reconnoitring the
premises; peering and peeping to ascertain whether all the world was
at church, before he broke in to rifle the house?</p>

<p>No one, void of such an experience, can imagine how dark he looked
standing there, amidst the whiteness of all the scene around. In one
sense, he stood out plainer than he could have done by daylight,
because the contrast was greater. But this sort of light did not show
his features, which were shrouded in obscurity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently he moved. Looking to right and left, he took a step
forward. Evidently he was trying to see whether the parlour where
I sat was empty or occupied. Should I go out to him? Or should I
fling up the window and ask what he wanted? I was not frightened:
don&rsquo;t let any one think that: but watching him brought rather a creepy
kind of sensation.</p>

<p>And, just then, as I left the chair quietly to open the window, I
heard the catch of the garden-gate, and some one came whistling up
the path. The man vanished as if by magic. Whilst I looked, he
was gone. It seemed to me that I did not take my eyes off him; but
where he went to, or what became of him, I knew not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anybody at home?&rdquo; called out Tom Coney, as he broke off his
whistling and opened the hall-door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Tom. Come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, to tell the truth, I was not sorry to see Tom&rsquo;s hearty face.
He had stayed away from evening service to sit with his mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Tom, did you see any fellow on the snow there, as you
came in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the snow where?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There; just before the shrubs.&rdquo; And I pointed the spot out to
him, and told him what had happened. Tom, one of the most practical
fellows living, more so, I think, than even Tod, and with less imagination
than an ostrich, received the account with incredulity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dropped asleep, Johnny, and fancied it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not drop asleep, and I did not fancy it. When you came
into the garden I was about to open the window and call to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those headaches are downright stupefying things, Johnny. Jane
has them, you know. One day I remember she fell asleep with a bad
one, and woke up and said the sofa was on fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tom, I tell you the man was there. A tall, strong-looking fellow,
with a beard. He was staring at the house with all his might, at this
room, as it seemed to me, wanting to come forward, I think, but afraid
to. He kept close to the laurels, as if he did not wish to be seen,
forgetting perhaps that they were white and betrayed him. When you
opened the gate, he was there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s odd, then, where he could have put himself,&rdquo; said Tom Coney,
not giving in an inch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll vow not a soul was there, man or woman,
when I came up the path.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. He vanished in a moment. Whilst I was looking at
him he disappeared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vanished! Disappeared! You talk as though you thought it a
ghost, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ghost be hanged! It was some ill-doing tramp, I expect, trying
to look if he might steal into the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much you know of the ways of tramps, Johnny Ludlow! Tramps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
don&rsquo;t come showing themselves on snow-lighted, open lawns, in the
face and eyes of the front windows: they hide themselves in obscure
hedges and byways. It&rsquo;s a case of headachy sleep, young man, and
nothing else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Tom. If the man was there, his footprints will be
there; if he was not, as you say, the snow will be smooth and level:
come out and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We went out at once, Tom catching up a stick in the hall, and
crossed the lawn. I was right, and Tom wrong. Sure enough, there
were the footprints, plenty of them, indented in the deep snow. Tom
gave in then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to goodness I had seen him! The fellow should not have
got off scot-free, I can tell him that. What tremendous feet he must
have! Just look at the size, Johnny. Regular crushers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go and say again I was asleep! He must have stepped
back and got away through these laurels; yes, here are the marks. I
say, Tom&rdquo;&mdash;dropping my voice to a whisper&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps he&rsquo;s here
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon see that,&rdquo; said Tom Coney, plunging amidst the laurels
with a crash, and beating about with the stick.</p>

<p>But there was no trace of him. Tom came out presently, covered
with the beaten snow, and we went indoors; he veering round partly
to his first opinion, and a little incredulous, in spite of the footprints.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If any man was there, Johnny, how did he get away? I don&rsquo;t
see, for my part, what he could possibly want. A thief would have
gone to work in a different manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let it be so. I shall say nothing about it to them when they
come home. Mrs. Todhetley&rsquo;s timid, you know, she would fancy the
man was outside still, and be lying awake all night, listening for the
smashing in of doors and windows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cracking the fire into a blaze; as much of a blaze, that is, as its
dilapidated state allowed; I called Thomas to light the lamp and shut
the shutters. When I told him of the affair, bidding him not mention
it, he took a different view of it altogether, and put it down to the
score of one of the younger maid-servants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got sweethearts, Master Johnny, the huzzies have; lots of
sweethearts. One or the t&rsquo;other of &rsquo;em is always a sidling sheepfaced
up to the house, as though he didn&rsquo;t dare to say his soul was his
own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They came in from church before the fire had burnt up, and the
Squire scolded me for letting it go so low. The coal we get in Worcestershire
is the Staffordshire coal; it does not burn up in a minute as
London coal does, but must have time.</p>

<p>Nothing of course was said about the man; I and Tom Coney&mdash;who
stayed supper&mdash;held our tongues, as agreed upon. But I told Tod in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
going up to bed. He was sleepy, and did not think much of it. The
fact was, as I could plainly perceive, that to any of them, when related,
it did not seem to be much. They had not seen it as I had.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Timberdale Rectory, a cosy, old-fashioned house, its front walls
covered with ivy, stood by itself amidst pasture-land, a field&rsquo;s length
from the church. Mrs. Todhetley sent me there on the Monday morning,
to invite the Rector, Herbert Tanerton, and his wife to dine with
us the next evening, for we had a prime codfish sent as a present from
London. The Squire and Tod had gone out shooting. It was January
weather; cold and bright, with a frosty sky. Icicles drooped from the
trees, and the snow in Crabb Ravine was above my ankles. The mater
had said to me, &ldquo;I should go the road way, Johnny;&rdquo; but I did not
mind the snow.</p>

<p>In Timberdale I met Margaret Rymer. She had her black cloak on,
and her natty little black bonnet; and the gentle and refined face under
it, with its mild brown eyes, put me more than ever in mind of her
dead father.</p>

<p>Does any one remember her? I told something about her and her
people early in this volume. When Thomas Rymer died, partly of a
broken heart, Benjamin had again gone off, and Margaret continued to
keep the business going. She understood the drugs thoroughly. During
all the months that had elapsed since, the son had not made his appearance
at home. Timberdale would say, &ldquo;Why does not Benjamin come
back to carry on affairs in his father&rsquo;s place?&rdquo; but it had no satisfactory
answer. Latterly, Timberdale had let Benjamin alone, and busied itself
with Margaret.</p>

<p>Six months ago, the Reverend Isaac Sale had come to Timberdale as
curate. He was a plain, dark little man of sterling worth, and some
thirty years of age&mdash;older than the Rector. Margaret Rymer met him
at the Sunday School, where she taught regularly, and he fell desperately
in love with her&mdash;if it&rsquo;s not wrong to say that of a parson. As
a rule, men and women like contrasts; and perhaps the somewhat
abrupt-mannered man with the plain and rugged features had been
irresistibly attracted by the delicate face of Margaret, and by her
singularly gentle ways. In position she was not his equal; but Mr.
Sale made no secret of his attachment, or that he wanted Margaret to
be his wife. Mrs. Rymer entirely opposed it: how was the business
to be kept going without Margaret, she demanded; or herself, either?</p>

<p>Mr. Sale had taken the curacy as a temporary thing. He was waiting
for some expected appointment abroad. When it fell to him,
Margaret Rymer would have to choose between sailing with him as his
wife, or staying at home and giving him up for good. So said Timberdale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>After standing to talk a bit with Margaret, who had come out on an
errand for her mother, I ran on to the Rectory. Mr. Tanerton and his
wife were in the snug little bow-windowed front-room. He, spare and
colourless, young yet, with cold grey eyes and thin light whiskers, sat
by the blazing fire of wood and coal, that went roaring and sparkling up
the chimney. Somehow Herbert Tanerton gave you the idea of being
always in a chill. Well meaning, and kind in the main, he was yet
severe, taking too much note of offences, and expecting all the world,
and especially his own flock, to be better than gold.</p>

<p>His wife, kind, genial, and open-hearted, sat at the window, stitching
a wristband for one of her husband&rsquo;s new shirts&mdash;he was as particular
over <em>them</em> as he was over the parish sins&mdash;and glancing cheerfully out
between whiles at the snowy landscape. When she was Grace Coney,
and niece at the farm, we were very intimate; a nice, merry-hearted,
capable girl, rather tall and slender, with bright dark hazel eyes, and
a wide mouth that seemed always to be smiling to show its pretty
white teeth. Seeing me coming, she ran to open the porch-door. As
yet, she and Herbert had no children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, Johnny! Is it not a lovely day? Herbert thinks it the
coldest morning we have had; but I tell him that is because he does
not feel very well. And he has been put out a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo; I asked, as the Rector turned in his chair to shake
hands with me. For she had said all that in his hearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there are one or two things. Sam Mullett&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the use of talking of the stupid old man, Grace?&rdquo; cried
the parson, crossly. &ldquo;He is getting too old for his place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Sale is going to leave,&rdquo; added Mrs. Tanerton, as I sat
down by the table, after delivering the invitation. &ldquo;The appointment
he expected has been offered to him; it is a chaplaincy at the Bahama
Islands. Mr. Sale has known of it for a week, and never told Herbert
until yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He spoke to me in the vestry after morning service,&rdquo; said the
Rector, in an injured tone. &ldquo;And he said at the same time that he
was not sure he should accept it; it did not quite depend upon himself.
I saw as clearly what he meant to imply as though he had avowed it;
that it depended upon that girl, Margaret Rymer. It is a preposterous
thing. The idea of a clergyman and a gentleman wanting to marry
<em>her</em>! She keeps a chemist&rsquo;s shop!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was her father who kept it,&rdquo; I said eagerly, for I liked Margaret
Rymer, and did not care to hear her disparaged. &ldquo;And he was a
gentleman born.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has that to do with it?&rdquo; retorted the parson, who was in one
of his most touchy humours. &ldquo;Had her grandfather been a duke, it
would make no difference to what she is. Look at the mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Margaret is a lady in mind, in looks, and in manners,&rdquo; I persisted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
&ldquo;If I loved Margaret Rymer, I would marry her, though I were an
archdeacon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like you, Johnny Ludlow! you have no more sense than
a child in some things,&rdquo; said the parson, crustily. Grace glanced up
from her work and laughed; and looked as if she would like to take
part with me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never could have suspected Sale of such folly,&rdquo; went on the
Rector, warming his hands over the blaze. &ldquo;Grace, do you think that
soup&rsquo;s ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will see,&rdquo; answered Grace, putting the wristband on the little
work-table; and she touched my shoulder playfully in passing.</p>

<p>Herbert Tanerton sat in silence; knitting his brow into lines. I took
the chair on the other side the fireplace opposite to him, thinking of
this and that, and fingering the tongs to help me: a habit I was often
scolded for at home&mdash;that of fingering things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Mr. Tanerton. If they go all the way out to settle at
the Bahamas, it will not signify there who Margaret has been here.
Whether she may have helped in her father&rsquo;s business, or whether
she may have been&mdash;as you said&mdash;a duke&rsquo;s granddaughter, and brought
up accordingly, it will be all one to the Bahamas. Mr. Sale need not
say to the Bahamas, &lsquo;My wife used to sell pennyworths of rhubarb
and magnesia.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not that,&rdquo; crossly responded the Rector&mdash;&ldquo;what people will
think or say; it is for Sale&rsquo;s own sake that I object. He cannot like
the connection. A clergyman should marry in his own sphere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose men are differently constituted, clergymen as well as
others,&rdquo; said I, with deprecation, remembering that I was a plain, inexperienced
lad, and he was the Rector of Timberdale. &ldquo;Some persons
don&rsquo;t care for social distinctions as others do, don&rsquo;t even see them:
perhaps Mr. Sale is one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He cares for probity and honour&mdash;he would not choose to ally
himself to crime, to disgrace,&rdquo; sternly spoke the Rector. &ldquo;And he
would do that in marrying Margaret Rymer. Remember what the son
did, that ill-doing Benjamin,&rdquo; added he, dropping his voice. &ldquo;You
know all about it, Johnny. The affair of the bank-note, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And if Herbert Tanerton had said to me the affair of the moon and
planets, I could not have been more surprised. &ldquo;How did you get to
know of it?&rdquo; I asked, when speech came to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rymer told me on his death-bed. I was attending him
spiritually. Of course, I have never spoken of it, even to my wife&mdash;I
should not think of speaking of it; but I consider that it lies in my
duty to disclose the facts to Mr. Sale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t, please, Mr. Tanerton!&rdquo; I cried out, starting
up in a sort of distress, for the words seemed to take hold of me. &ldquo;No
one knows of it: no one but the Squire, and I, as you say, and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Rymer, and you, and Ben himself; Jelf&rsquo;s dead, you know. It need
never be brought up again in this world; and I dare say it never will
be. Pray don&rsquo;t tell Mr. Sale&mdash;for Margaret&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have said that I consider it my duty to tell him,&rdquo; replied the
parson, steadily. &ldquo;Here he comes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I turned to the window, and saw Sale trudging up to the parsonage
through the snowy field pathway, his black hair and red rugged face
presenting a sort of contrast to the white glare around. Ugly, he might
be called; but it was a face to be liked, for all that. And the ring of
his voice was true and earnest.</p>

<p>The affair of the bank-note had helped to kill Thomas Rymer, and
sent Mr. Ben off on his wanderings again. It was a bit of ill-luck for
Ben, for he had really pulled up, was reading hard at his medical books,
and become as steady as could be. Never since then&mdash;some ten
months ago now&mdash;had Ben been heard of; never had it been spoken of
to man or woman. <em>Need</em> Herbert Tanerton disclose it to the curate?
No: and I did not think he would do it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were just talking of you,&rdquo; was the Rector&rsquo;s greeting to Mr.
Sale, as the curate came into the room. &ldquo;Bring a chair to the front of
the fire: Johnny, keep your seat. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s cold enough to make
one wish to be in the fire to-day, instead of before it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you saying about me?&rdquo; asked Mr. Sale, drawing forward
the chair to sit down, as bidden, and giving me a nod in his short
way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you come to tell me your decision&mdash;to go or stay?&rdquo; asked
the Rector, neglecting to answer the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not this morning. My decision is not yet made. I came to tell
you how very ill Jael Batty is. I&rsquo;m not at all sure that she will get
over this bout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the Rector, in a slighting tone, as if Jael Batty had no
right to intrude herself into more momentous conversation. &ldquo;Jael
Batty is careless and indifferent in her duties, anything but what she
ought to be, and makes her deafness an excuse for not coming to
church. I&rsquo;ll try and get out to see her in the course of the day. She
is always having these attacks. What we were speaking of was your
friendship with Miss Rymer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herbert Tanerton, as I have said, meant to be kind, and I believe he
had people&rsquo;s welfare at heart; but he had a severe way of saying things
that seemed to take all the kindness out of his words. He was a great
stickler for &ldquo;duty,&rdquo; and if once he considered it was his duty to tell
a fellow of his faults, tell he did, face to face, in the most uncompromising
manner. He had decided that it was his duty to hold forth to
Mr. Sale, and he plunged into the discourse without ceremony. The
curate did not seem in the least put out, but talked back again, quietly
and freely. I sat balancing the tongs over the fender and listening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Rymer is not my equal, you say,&rdquo; observed Sale. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know that. Her father was a curate&rsquo;s son: I am a curate&rsquo;s son.
Circumstances, it would seem, kept Mr. Rymer down in the world.
Perhaps they will keep me down&mdash;I cannot tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are a gentleman in position, a clergyman; Rymer served
customers,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Tanerton, harping upon that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bête noire</i> of his,
the chemist&rsquo;s shop. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you perceive the difference? A gentleman
ought to be a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thomas Rymer was a gentleman, as I hear, in mind and manners
and conduct; educated, and courteous, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was one of the truest gentlemen I ever met,&rdquo; I could not help
putting in, though it interrupted the curate. &ldquo;For my part, when
speaking with him I forgot the counter he served at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a true Christian, I was about to say,&rdquo; added Mr. Sale.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Herbert Tanerton, who had been fidgeting in
his chair, spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I mistaken in assuming that your acceptance of this chaplaincy
depends upon Miss Rymer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you are not mistaken,&rdquo; said Sale, readily. &ldquo;It does depend
upon her. If she will go with me&mdash;my wife&mdash;I shall accept it; if she
will not, I remain at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Margaret is as nice as her father was; she is exactly like him,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;Were I you, Mr. Sale, I should just take her out of the place
and end it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if she won&rsquo;t come with me?&rdquo; returned he, with a half-smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is wanted at home,&rdquo; observed Herbert Tanerton, casting a
severe look at me with his cold light eyes. &ldquo;That shop could not get
on without her.&rdquo; But Sale interrupted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot imagine why the son is not at home to attend to things.
It is his place to be there doing it, not his sister&rsquo;s. He is inclined to
be wild, it is said, and given to roving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wildness is not Benjamin Rymer&rsquo;s worst fault, or roving either,&rdquo;
cried the Rector, in his hardest voice, though he dropped it to a low
key. And forthwith he opened the ball, and told the unfortunate story
in a very few words. I let the tongs fall with a rattle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not have mentioned this,&rdquo; pursued he, &ldquo;but that I consider
it lies in my duty to tell you of it. To any one else it would never be
allowed to pass my lips; it never has passed them since Mr. Rymer
disclosed it to me a day or two before he died. Margaret Rymer may
be desirable in herself; but there&rsquo;s her position, and&mdash;there&rsquo;s <em>this</em>. It
is for your own sake I have spoken, Mr. Sale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sale had sat still and quiet while he listened. There was nothing
outward to show that the tale affected him, but instinct told me that it
<em>did</em>. Just a question or two he put, as to the details, and then he rose
to leave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not let it sway you?&rdquo; asked the Rector, perseveringly, as
he held out his hand to his curate. And I was sure he thought he had
been doing him the greatest good in the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell,&rdquo; replied Mr. Sale.</p>

<p>He went out, walked across the garden, and through the gate to the
field, with his head down. A dreadful listlessness&mdash;as it seemed to me&mdash;had
taken the place of his brisk bearing. Just for a minute I stood
in the parlour where I was, feeling as though I had had a shower of ice
thrown down upon me and might never be warm again. Saying a
short good-morning, I rushed out after him, nearly upsetting Mrs.
Tanerton in the hall, and a basin of soup she was carrying in on a plate.
How cruel it seemed; how cruel! Why can&rsquo;t people let one another
alone? He was half-way across the field when I overtook him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sale, I want to tell you&mdash;I ought to tell you&mdash;that the story,
as repeated to you by Mr. Tanerton, bears a worse aspect than the
reality would warrant. It is true that Benjamin Rymer did change the
note in the letter; but that was the best and the worst of it. He had
become mixed up with some reckless men when at Tewkesbury, and
they persuaded him to get the stolen note changed for a safe one. I
am sure he repented of it truly. When he came home later to his
father&rsquo;s, he had left all his random ways and bad companions behind
him. Nobody could be steadier than he was; kind to Margaret, considerate
to his father and mother, attentive to business, and reading
hard all his spare time. It was only through an ill fellow coming here
to hunt him up&mdash;one Cotton, who was the man that induced him to
play the trick with the note&mdash;that he was disturbed again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How disturbed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He grew frightened, I mean, and went away. That fellow Cotton
deserved hanging. When he found that Ben Rymer would have
nothing more to do with him, or with the rest of the bad lot, he, in
revenge, told Jelf, the landlord of the Plough and Harrow (where
Cotton ran up a score, and decamped without paying), saying that it
was Ben Rymer who had changed the note&mdash;for, you see, it had always
remained a mystery to Timberdale. Jelf&mdash;he is dead now&mdash;was foolish
enough to let Ben Rymer know what Cotton had said, and Ben made
off in alarm. In a week&rsquo;s time Mr. Rymer was dead. He had been
ailing in mind and body for a long while, and the new fear finished
him up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A pause ensued. Sale broke it. &ldquo;Did Miss Rymer know of this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of Ben and the bank-note? I don&rsquo;t believe she knows of it to this
hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I feel sure she does not,&rdquo; added Sale, speaking more to himself
than to me. &ldquo;She is truth and candour itself; and she has repeatedly
said to me she cannot tell why her brother keeps away; cannot imagine
why.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;no one knows of it, except myself, but
Squire Todhetley and Mr. Tanerton. We should never, never think of
bringing it up, any one of us; Mr. Tanerton only spoke of it, as he said,
because he thought he ought to tell you; he will never speak of it
again. Indeed, Mr. Sale, you need not fear it will be known. Benjamin
Rymer is quite safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of a man is he, this Benjamin?&rdquo; resumed Sale, halting
at the outer gate of the field as we were going through it. &ldquo;Like the
father, or like the mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like the mother. But not as vulgar as she is. Ben has been
educated; she was not; and though he does take after her, there&rsquo;s a
little bit of his father in him as well. Which makes a great difference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without another word, Mr. Sale turned abruptly off to the right, as
though he were going for a country ramble. I shut the gate, and made
the best of my way home, bearing back the message from the Rector
and Grace&mdash;that they would come and help eat the codfish.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Reverend Isaac Sale was that day sorely exercised in mind.
The story he had heard shook his equanimity to the centre. To marry
a young lady whose brother stood a chance of being prosecuted for
felony looked like a very black prospect indeed; but, on the other
hand, Margaret at least was innocent, and he loved and respected her
with his whole heart and soul. Not until the evening was his mind
made up; he had debated the question with himself in all its bearings
(seated on the stump of a snowy tree); and the decision he arrived at,
was&mdash;to take Margaret all the same. He <em>could not</em> leave her.</p>

<p>About nine o&rsquo;clock he went to Mrs. Rymer&rsquo;s. The shop was closed,
and Mr. Sale entered by the private door. Margaret sat in the parlour
alone, reading; Mrs. Rymer was out. In her soft black dress, with its
white frilling at the throat, Margaret did not look anything like her
nearly twenty years. Her mild brown eyes and tale-telling cheeks
lighted up at the entrance of the curate. Letting her nervous little
hand meet his strong one, she would have drawn a chair forward for
him, but he kept her standing by him on the hearthrug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come this evening to have some final conversation with you,
Margaret, and I am glad your mother is out,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Will you
hear me, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I am always glad to hear you,&rdquo; she said in low, timid
tones. And Mr. Sale made no more ado, but turned and kissed her.
Then he released her hand, sat down opposite to her on the other side
of the hearth, and entered on his argument.</p>

<p>It was no more, or other, than she had heard from him before&mdash;the
whole sum and substance of it consisted of representations why he must
accept this chaplaincy at the Bahamas, and why she must accompany
him thither. In the midst of it Margaret burst into tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Isaac, why prolong the pain?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You know I <em>cannot</em>
go: to refuse is as painful to me as to you. Don&rsquo;t you see that I have
no alternative but to remain here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not see it,&rdquo; replied Mr. Sale, stoutly. &ldquo;I think your
mother could do without you. She is an active, bustling woman, hardly
to be called middle-aged yet. It is not right that you should sacrifice
yourself and your prospects in life. At least, it seems to me that it
is not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret&rsquo;s hand was covering her face; the silent tears were dropping.
To see him depart, leaving her behind, was a prospect intensely
bitter. Her heart ached when she thought of it: but she saw no hope
of its being otherwise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a week and a day since I told you that the promotion was at
length offered me,&rdquo; resumed Mr. Sale, &ldquo;and we do not seem to be any
nearer a decision than we were then. I have kept it to myself and said
nothing about it abroad, waiting for you to speak to me, Margaret; and
the Rector&mdash;to whom I at length spoke yesterday&mdash;is angry with me,
and says I ought to have told him at once. In three days from this&mdash;on
Thursday next&mdash;I <em>must</em> give an answer: accept the post, or throw it
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret took her hand from her face. Mr. Sale could see how
great was the conflict at work within her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to wait for, Isaac. I wish there was. You must
go by yourself, and leave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told you that I will not. If you stay here, I stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, pray don&rsquo;t do that! It would be so intense a disappointment
to you to give it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The greatest disappointment I have ever had in life,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;You must go with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could! I wish I could! But it is impossible. My duty
lies here, Isaac. I wish you could see that fact as strongly as I see it.
My poor father always enjoined me to do my duty, no matter at what
personal cost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is your brother&rsquo;s duty to be here, Margaret; not yours. Where
is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In London, I believe,&rdquo; she replied, and a faint colour flew into her
pale face. She put up her handkerchief to hide it.</p>

<p>It had come to Margaret&rsquo;s knowledge that during the past few months
her mother had occasionally written to Benjamin. But Mrs. Rymer
would not allow Margaret to write or give her his address. It chanced,
however, that about a fortnight ago Mrs. Rymer incautiously left a
letter on the table addressed to him, and her daughter saw it. When,
some days subsequently, Mr. Sale received the offer of the chaplaincy,
and laid it and himself before Margaret, urging her to accompany him,
saying that he could not go without her, she took courage to write to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Benjamin. She did not ask him to return and release her; she only
asked him whether he had any intention of returning, and if so, when;
and she gave him in simple words the history of her acquaintanceship
with Mr. Sale, and said that he wanted her to go out with him to the
Bahamas. To this letter Margaret had not received any answer. She
therefore concluded that it had either not reached her brother, or else
that he did not mean to return at all to Timberdale; and so she gave
up all hopes of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Life is not very long, Margaret, and God has placed us in it to do
the best we can in all ways; for Him first, for social obligations afterwards.
But He has not meant it to be all trial, all self-denial. If you
and I part now, the probability is that we part for ever. Amidst the
world&rsquo;s chances and changes we may never meet again, howsoever our
wills might prompt it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; she faintly answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I say that you ought not to enforce this weighty penance upon
me and yourself. It is for your brother&rsquo;s sake, as I look upon it, that
you are making the sacrifice, and it is he, not you, who ought to be
here. Why did he go away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never knew,&rdquo; said Margaret, lifting her eyes to her lover&rsquo;s, and
speaking so confidingly and earnestly that, had he needed proof to convince
him she was ignorant of the story he had that day been regaled
with, it would have amply afforded it. &ldquo;Benjamin was at home, and
so steady and good as to be a comfort to papa; when quite suddenly
he left without giving a reason. Papa seemed to be in trouble about it&mdash;it
was only a few days before he died&mdash;and I have thought that perhaps
poor Benjamin was unexpectedly called upon to pay some debt or
other, and could not find the money to do it. He had not always been
quite so steady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Margaret, I think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A loud bang of the entrance-door, and a noisy burst into the room,
proclaimed the return of Mrs. Rymer. Her mass of scarlet curls
garnished her face on either side, and looked particularly incongruous
with her widow&rsquo;s cap and bonnet. Mr. Sale, rising to hand her a chair,
broke off what he had been about to say to Margaret, and addressed
Mrs. Rymer instead; simply saying that the decision, as to her going out
with him, or not going, could no longer be put off, but must be made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been made,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Rymer, disregarding the offered
chair, and standing to hold her boots, one after the other, to the fire.
&ldquo;Margaret can&rsquo;t go, Mr. Sale; you know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I wish her to go, and she wishes it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a puzzle to me what on earth you can see in her,&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Rymer, flinging her grey muff on the table, and untying her black
bonnet-strings to tilt back the bonnet. &ldquo;Margaret won&rsquo;t have any
money. Not a penny piece.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not thinking about money,&rdquo; replied the curate; who somehow
could never keep his temper long in the presence of this strong-minded
Amazon. &ldquo;It is Margaret that I want; not money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s Margaret, then, that you can&rsquo;t have,&rdquo; she retorted.
&ldquo;Who is to keep the shop on if she leaves it?&mdash;it can&rsquo;t go to rack and
ruin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you serving in it yourself sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can serve the stationery&mdash;and the pickles and fish sauce&mdash;and the
pearl barley,&rdquo; contended she, &ldquo;but not the drugs. I don&rsquo;t meddle with
them. When a prescription comes in to be made up, if I attempted to
do it I might put opium for senna, and poison people. I have not
learnt Latin, as Margaret has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mrs. Rymer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll just drop the subject, sir, if it&rsquo;s all the same to you,&rdquo;
loudly put in Mrs. Rymer. &ldquo;I have told you before that Margaret must
stay where she is, and keep the business together for me and her
brother. No need to repeat it fifty times over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She caught up her muff, and went out of the room and up the stairs
as she delivered this final edict. Mr. Sale rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see how it is,&rdquo; said Margaret, in a low tone of emotion, and
keeping her eyelids down to hide the tears. &ldquo;You must go without
me. I cannot leave. I can only say, God speed you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are many wrongs enacted in this world, and this is one,&rdquo; he
replied in a hard voice&mdash;not hard for her&mdash;as he took her hands in his,
and stood before her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I altogether blame you,
Margaret; but it is cruel upon you and upon me. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went out quite abruptly without kissing her, leaving her alone
with her aching heart.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Tuesday afternoon, and the ice and the snow on the ground still.
We were to dine at five o&rsquo;clock&mdash;the London codfish and a prime
turkey&mdash;and the Coneys were coming in as well as the Rector and his
wife.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Coney did not come; old Coney and Tom brought in word
that she was not feeling well enough; and the Tanertons only drove
up on the stroke of five. As I helped Grace down from the pony-chaise,
muffled up to the chin in furs, for the cold was enough to freeze
an Icelander&rsquo;s nose off, I told her her aunt was not well enough to
come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Coney not well enough to come!&rdquo; returned Grace. &ldquo;What
a pity! Have I time to run in to see her before dinner, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you&rsquo;ve not. You are late, as it is. The Squire has been
telling us all that the fish must be in rags already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grace laughed as she ran in; her husband followed her unwinding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the folds of his white woollen comforter. There was a general greeting
and much laughter, especially when old Coney told Grace that her
cheeks were as purple as his Sunday necktie. In the midst of it
Thomas announced dinner.</p>

<p>The codfish came up all right, and the oyster sauce was in Molly&rsquo;s
best style&mdash;made of cream, and plenty of oysters in it. The turkey
was fine: the plum-pudding better than good. Hugh and Lena sat at
the table; and altogether we had a downright merry dinner. Not a
sober face amongst us, except Herbert Tanerton&rsquo;s: as to his face&mdash;well,
you might have thought he was perpetually saying &ldquo;For what we are
going to receive&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; It had struck eight ever so long when the last
nut was eaten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you run over with me to my aunt&rsquo;s, Johnny?&rdquo; whispered Grace
as she passed my chair. &ldquo;I should like to go at once, if you will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I followed her out of the room. She put her wraps on, and we
went trudging across the road in the moonlight, over the crunching
snow. Grace&rsquo;s foot went into a soft rut, and she gave a squeal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall have to borrow a shoe whilst this dries,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Do
you care to come in, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll go back. I can run over for you presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that. One of the servants will see me safe across.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. Tell Mrs. Coney what a jolly dinner it was. We were
all sorry she did not come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grace went in and shut the door. I was rushing back through our
own gate, when some tall fellow glided out of the laurels, and put his
hand on my arm. The moonlight fell upon his face and its reddish
beard&mdash;and, to my intense surprise, I recognized Benjamin Rymer. I
knew him then for the man who had been dodging in and out of the
shrubs the night but one before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is, as I am well aware, a very
unusual and unceremonious way of accosting you, or any one else, but
I want particularly to speak with you, in private, Mr. Ludlow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were here on Sunday night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I saw the Squire and the rest of them go out to church, but
I did not see you go, and I was trying to ascertain whether you were
at home and alone. Tom Coney&rsquo;s coming in startled me and sent me
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had been speaking in a low key, but Ben Rymer dropped his to
a lower, as he explained. When he went away ten months before, it
was in fear and dread that the truth of the escapade he had been guilty
of, in regard to the bank-note, was coming out to the world, and that he
might be called upon to answer for it. His mother had since assured
him he had nothing to fear; but Ben was evidently a cautious man,
and preferred to ascertain that fact before showing himself openly at
Timberdale. Knowing I was to be trusted not to injure a fellow (as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
was pleased to say), he had come down here to ask me my opinion as
to whether the Squire would harm him, or not. There was no one else
to fear now Jelf was dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harm you!&rdquo; I exclaimed in my enthusiasm, my head full of poor,
patient Margaret; &ldquo;why, the Squire would be the very one to hold you
free of harm, Mr. Rymer. I remember his saying, at the time, Heaven
forbid that he, having sons of his own, should put a stumbling-block in
your path, when you were intending to turn over a new leaf. He will
help you on, instead of harming you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of him,&rdquo; said Ben. &ldquo;I was an awful fool, and
nothing else. That was the only dangerous thing I ever did, and I
have been punished severely for it. I believe it was nothing but the
fear and remorse it brought that induced me to pull up, and throw ill
ways behind me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I am glad that you do,&rdquo; I answered, for something in
Ben&rsquo;s tone seemed to imply that the bad ways were thrown behind him
for good. &ldquo;Are you thinking of coming back to Timberdale?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not until I shall have passed for a surgeon&mdash;which will not be long
now. I have been with a surgeon in London as assistant, since I left
here. It was a letter from Margaret that induced me to come down.
She&mdash;do you know anything about her, Mr. Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that a parson wants her to go out with him to the Bahamas;
he is Tanerton&rsquo;s curate; and that the pills and powders stand in the
way of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so. Is he a good fellow, this parson?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good in himself. Not much to look at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maggie shall go with him, then. I should be the last to stand
willingly in her way. You see, I have not known whether it was safe
for me at Timberdale: or I should never have left Maggie to the shop
alone. Does any one know of the past&mdash;my past&mdash;besides you and the
Squire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; Herbert Tanerton knows of it; and&mdash;and the curate, Mr.
Sale.&rdquo; And I told him what had passed only on the previous day,
softening the Rector&rsquo;s speeches&mdash;and it seemed a curious coincidence,
taken with this visit of Ben&rsquo;s, that it should have passed. His mouth
fell as he listened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is another mortification for me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I should like to have
stood as well as might be with Margaret&rsquo;s husband. Perhaps, knowing
this, he will not think more of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he will let it make any difference. I don&rsquo;t think he
is the man to let it. Perhaps&mdash;if you were to go to him&mdash;and show
him how straight things are with you now&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>I broke down in my hesitating suggestion. Ben was years older
than I, miles taller and broader, and it sounded like the mouse attempting
to help the lion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will go to him,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;It is the only plan. And&mdash;and
you think there&rsquo;s no fear that Herbert Tanerton will get talking
to others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s none. He is indoors now, dining with us. I am
sure you are quite safe in all respects. The thing is buried in the past,
and even its remembrance will pass away. The old postman, Lee,
thinks it was Cotton; the Squire persuaded him into the belief at the
time. Where <em>is</em> Cotton?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where all such rogues deserve to be&mdash;transported. But for him
and his friends I should never have done much that&rsquo;s wrong. Thank
you for the encouragement you give me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He half put out his hand to endorse the thanks, and drew it back
again; but I put mine freely into his. Ben Rymer <em>was</em> Ben Rymer,
and no favourite of mine to boot; but when a man has been down and
is trying to get up again, he deserves respect and sympathy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was about here all last evening, hoping to get sight of you,&rdquo; he
remarked, as he went out at the gate. &ldquo;I never saw such light nights
in all my life as these few last have been, what with the moon and the
snow. Good-night, Mr. Johnny. By the way, though, where does
the curate live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Mrs. Boughton&rsquo;s. Nearly the last house, you know, before you
come to the churchyard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben Rymer went striding towards Timberdale, putting his coat-collar
well up, that he might not be recognized when going through the
village, and arrived at the curate&rsquo;s lodgings. Mr. Sale was at home,
sitting by the fire in a brown study, that seemed to have no light at all
in it. Ben, as I knew later, sat down by him, and made a clean breast
of everything: his temptation, his fall, and his later endeavours to do
right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please God, I shall get on in the world now,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and I
think make a name in my profession. I don&rsquo;t wish to boast&mdash;and time
of course will alone prove it&mdash;but I believe I have a special aptitude for
surgery. My mother will be my care now; and Margaret&mdash;as you are
good enough to say you still wish for her&mdash;shall be your care in future.
There are few girls so deserving as she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said the curate. And he shook Ben&rsquo;s hand upon it
as heartily as though it had been a duke royal&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>It was close upon ten when Ben left him. Mrs. Rymer about that
same time was making her usual preparations before retiring&mdash;namely,
putting her curls in paper by the parlour fire. Margaret sat at the
table, reading the Bible in silence, and so trying to school her aching
heart. Her mother had been cross and trying all the evening: which
did not mend the inward pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you crying for?&rdquo; suddenly demanded Mrs. Rymer, her
sharp eyes seeing a tear fall on the book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;For nothing,&rdquo; faintly replied Margaret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Nothing!</em> Don&rsquo;t tell me. You are frizzling your bones over that
curate, Sale. I&rsquo;m sure <em>he</em> is a beauty to look at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret made no rejoinder; and just then the young servant put in
her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be there anything else wanted, missis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Rymer. &ldquo;You can be off to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, before the girl had shut the parlour-door, a loud ring came to
the outer one. Such late summonses were not unusual; they generally
meant a prescription to be made up. Whilst the girl went to the
door, Margaret closed the Bible, dried her eyes, and rose up to be in
readiness.</p>

<p>But instead of a prescription, there entered Mr. Benjamin Rymer.
His mother stood up, staring, her hair a mass of white corkscrews.
Ben clasped Margaret in his arms, and kissed her heartily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My goodness <em>me</em>!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Rymer. &ldquo;Is it you, Ben?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is, mother,&rdquo; said Ben, turning to her. &ldquo;Maggie, dear, you
look as though you did not know me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what on earth have you come for, in this startling way?&rdquo;
demanded Mrs. Rymer. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe your bed&rsquo;s aired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sleep between the blankets&mdash;the best place to-night. What
have I come for, you ask, mother? I have come home to stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Margaret was gazing at him, her mild eyes wide open, a spot of
hectic on each cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For your sake, Maggie,&rdquo; he whispered, putting his arm round her
waist, and bending his great red head (but not so red as his mother&rsquo;s)
down on her. &ldquo;I shall not much like to lose you, though, my little
sister. The Bahamas are further off than I could have wished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, for answer, poor Margaret, what with one thing and another,
sank quietly down in her chair, and fainted. Ben strode into the shop&mdash;as
much at home amongst the bottles as though he had never quitted
them&mdash;and came back with some sal volatile.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They were married in less than a month; for Mr. Sale&rsquo;s chaplaincy
would not wait for him. The Rector was ailing as usual, or said he
was, and Charles Ashton came over to perform the ceremony.
Margaret was in a bright dark silk, a light shawl, and a plain bonnet;
they were to go away from the church door, and the boxes were
already at the station. Ben, dressed well, and looking not unlike a
gentleman, gave her away; but there was no wedding-party. Mrs.
Rymer stayed at home in a temper, which I dare say nobody regretted:
she considered Margaret ought to have remained single. And after a
day or two spent in the seaport town they were to sail from, regaling
their eyes with the ships crowding the water, the Reverend Isaac Sale
and his wife embarked for their future home in the Bahama Isles.</p>

THE OTHER EARRING.</h2>


<p>&ldquo;And if I could make sure that you two boys would behave yourselves
and give me no trouble, possibly I might take you this year
just for a treat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Behave ourselves!&rdquo; exclaimed Tod, indignantly. &ldquo;Do you think
we are two children, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We would be as good as gold, sir,&rdquo; I added, turning eagerly to the
Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Johnny, I&rsquo;m not much afraid but that you would. Perhaps
I&rsquo;ll trust you both, then, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall see,&rdquo; added the pater, thinking it well to put in a little
qualification. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not quite a promise, mind. But it must be two
or three years now, I think, since you went to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems like six,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s four.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were talking of Worcester Races. At that period they used to
take place early in August. Dr. Frost had an unpleasant habit of
reassembling his pupils either the race-week or the previous one; and
to get over to the races was almost as difficult for Tod and for me as
though they had been run in California. To hear the pater say he
might perhaps take us this year, just as the Midsummer holidays were
drawing to an end, and say it voluntarily, was as good as it was
unexpected. He meant it, too; in spite of the reservation: and Dr.
Frost was warned that he need not expect us until the race-week was
at its close.</p>

<p>The Squire drove into Worcester on the Monday, to be ready for
the races on Tuesday morning, with Tod, myself, and the groom&mdash;Giles;
and put up, as usual, at the Star and Garter. Sometimes he
only drove in and back on each of the three race-days; or perhaps on
two of them: this he could do very well from Crabb Cot, but it was a
good pull for the horses from Dyke Manor. This year, to our intense
gratification, he meant to stay in the town.</p>

<p>The Faithful City was already in a bustle. It had put on its best
appearance, and had its windows cleaned; some of the shop-fronts
were being polished off as we drove slowly up the streets. Families
were, like ourselves, coming in: more would come before night. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
theatre was open, and we went to it after dinner; and saw, I
remember, &ldquo;Guy Mannering&rdquo; (over which the pater went to sleep),
and an after-piece with a ghost in it.</p>

<p>The next morning I took the nearest way from the hotel to Sansome
Walk, and went up it to call on one of our fellows who lived near the
top. His friends always let him stay at home for the race-week. A
maid-servant came running to answer my knock at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Harry Parker at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; answered the girl, who seemed to be cleaning up for the
races on her own account, for her face and arms were all &ldquo;colly.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Master Harry have gone down to Pitchcroft, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope he has gone early enough!&rdquo; said I, feeling disappointed.
&ldquo;Why, the races won&rsquo;t begin for hours yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I suppose there&rsquo;s a deal more life to be seen
there than here, though it is early in the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That might easily be. For of all solitary places Sansome Walk was,
in those days, the dreariest, especially portions of it. What with the
overhanging horse-chestnut trees, and the high dead wall behind those
on the one hand, and the flat stretch of lonely fields on the other,
Sansome Walk was what Harry Parker used to call a caution. You
might pass through all its long length from end to end and never meet
a soul.</p>

<p>Taking that narrow by-path on my way back that leads into the
Tything by St. Oswald&rsquo;s Chapel, and whistling a bar of the sweet song
I had heard at the theatre overnight, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing half so sweet
in life as love&rsquo;s young dream,&rdquo; some one came swiftly advancing down
the same narrow path, and I prepared to back sideways to give her
room to pass&mdash;a young woman, with a large shabby shawl on, and the
remains of faded gentility about her.</p>

<p>It was Lucy Bird! As she drew near, lifting her sad sweet eyes to
mine with a mournful smile, my heart gave a great throb of pity.
Faded, worn, anxious, reduced!&mdash;oh, how unlike she was, poor girl, to
the once gay and charming Lucy Ashton!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Lucy! I did not expect to see you in Worcester! We
heard you had left it months ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we left last February for London,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Captain
Bird has only come down for the races.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she took her hand from under her shawl to respond to mine, I
saw that she was carrying some cheese and a paper of cold cooked
meat. She must have been buying the meat at the cook&rsquo;s shop, as
the Worcester people called it, which was in the middle of High
Street. Oh! what a change&mdash;what a change for the delicately-bred
Lucy Ashton! Better that her Master of Ravenswood had buried
his horse and himself in the flooded land, as the other one did, than
have brought her to this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to, down this dismal place, Lucy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Home,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;We have taken lodgings at the top of
Sansome Walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At one of the cottages a little beyond it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, at one of those. How are you all, Johnny? How is Mrs.
Todhetley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s first-rate. Got no neuralgia just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she at Worcester?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; at Dyke Manor. She would not come. The Squire drove us
in yesterday. We are at the Star.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! yes,&rdquo; she said, her eyes taking a dreamy, far-off look. &ldquo;I
remember staying at the Star myself one race-week. Papa brought me.
It was the year I left school. Have you heard or seen anything of my
brothers lately, Johnny Ludlow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not since we were last staying at Crabb Cot. We went to Timberdale
Church one day and heard your brother Charles preach; and
we dined once with Robert at the Court, and he and his wife came
once to dine with us. But&mdash;have you not seen your brother James
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;and I would rather not see him. He would be sure to ask
me painful questions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he is always about the streets here, seeing after his patients,
Lucy. I wonder you have not met him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We only came down last Saturday: and I go out as little as I can,&rdquo;
she said; a hesitation in her tone and manner that struck me. &ldquo;I did
think I saw James&rsquo;s carriage before me just now as I came up the
Tything. It turned into Britannia Square.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say. We met it yesterday in Sidbury as we drove in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His practice grows large, I suppose. You say Charles was preaching
at Timberdale?&rdquo; she added: &ldquo;was Herbert Tanerton ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Ailing, that is. Your brother came over to take the duty
for the day. Will you call at the Star to see the Squire, Lucy? You
know how pleased he would be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;o,&rdquo; she answered, her manner still more hesitating; and she
seemed to be debating some matter mentally. &ldquo;I&mdash;I would have come
after dark, had Mrs. Todhetley been there. At least I think I would&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can come all the same, Lucy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But no&mdash;that would not have done,&rdquo; she went on to herself, in a
half-whisper. &ldquo;I might have been seen. It would never have done
to risk it. The truth is, Johnny, I ought to see Mrs. Todhetley on a
matter of business. Though even if she were here, I do not know that
I might dare to see her. It is&mdash;not exactly my own business&mdash;and&mdash;and
mischief might come of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it anything I can say to her for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;think&mdash;you might,&rdquo; she returned slowly, pausing, as before,
between her words. &ldquo;I know you are to be trusted, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I am. I wouldn&rsquo;t forget a single item of the message.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not mean in that way. I shall have to entrust to you a
private matter&mdash;a disagreeable secret. It is a long time that I have
wanted to tell some of you; ever since last winter: and yet, now that
the opportunity has come that I may do it, I scarcely dare. The
Squire is hasty and impulsive, his son is proud; but I think I may
confide in you, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only try me, Lucy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I will. <em>I will.</em> I know you are true as steel. Not this
morning, for I cannot stop&mdash;and I am not prepared. Let me see:
where shall we meet again? No, no, Johnny, I cannot venture to the
hotel: it is of no use to suggest that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I come to your lodgings?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She just shook her head by way of dissent, and remained in silent
thought. I could not imagine what it was she had to tell me that
required all this preparation; but it came into my mind to be glad that
I had chanced to go that morning to Harry Parker&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you meet me in Sansome Walk this afternoon, Johnny
Ludlow? Say at&rdquo;&mdash;considering&mdash;&ldquo;yes, at four o&rsquo;clock. That will be
a safe hour, for they will be on the racecourse and out of the way.
People will, I mean,&rdquo; she added hastily: but somehow I did not think
she had meant people. &ldquo;Can you come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will manage it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, if you don&rsquo;t meet me at that time&mdash;it is just possible that I
may be prevented coming out&mdash;I will be there at eight o&rsquo;clock this
evening instead,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;That I know I can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. I&rsquo;ll be sure to be there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hardly waiting another minute to say good-morning, she went
swiftly on. I began wondering what excuse I could make for leaving
the Squire&rsquo;s carriage in the midst of the sport, and whether he would
let me leave it.</p>

<p>But the way for that was paved without any effort of mine. At the
early lunch, the Squire, in the openness of his heart, offered a seat in
the phaeton to some old acquaintance from Martley. Which of course
would involve Tod&rsquo;s sitting behind with me, and Giles&rsquo;s being left out
altogether.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catch me at it,&rdquo; cried Tod. &ldquo;You can do as you please, Johnny:
I shall go to the course on foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will also,&rdquo; I said&mdash;though you, naturally, understand that I had
never expected to sit elsewhere than behind. And I knew it would be
easier for me to lose Tod in the crowd, and so get away to keep the
appointment, than it would have been to elude the Squire&rsquo;s questioning
as to why I could want to leave the carriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Lunch over, Tod said he would go to the Bell, to see whether the
Letstoms had come in; and we started off. No; the waiter had seen
nothing of them. Onwards, down Broad Street we went, took the
Quay, and so got on that way to Pitchcroft&mdash;as the racecourse is called.
The booths and shows were at this end, and the chief part of the
crowd. Before us lay stretched the long expanse of the course, green
and level as a bowling-green. The grand-stand (comparatively speaking
a new erection there) lay on the left, higher up, the winning-chair and
distance-post facing it. Behind the stand, flanking all that side of
Pitchcroft, the beautiful river Severn flowed along between its green
banks, the houses of Henwick, opposite, looking down upon it from
their great height, over their sloping gardens. It was a hot day, the
blue sky dark and cloudless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True and correct card of all the running horses, gentlemen: the
names, weights, and colours o&rsquo; the riders!&rdquo; The words, echoing on
all sides from the men who held these cards for sale, are repeated in
my brain now; as are other sounds and sights. I was somewhat older
then than I had been; but it was not very long since those shows,
ranged round there side by side, a long line of them, held the greatest
attraction for me in life. &ldquo;Guy Mannering,&rdquo; the past night, had been
very nice to see, very enjoyable; but it possessed not the nameless
charm of that first &ldquo;play&rdquo; I went to in Scowton&rsquo;s Show on the racecourse.
<em>That</em> charm could never come again. And I was but a lad yet.</p>

<p>The lightning with which the play opened had been real lightning to
me; the thunder, real thunder. The gentleman who stood, when the
curtain rose, gorgeously attired in a scarlet doublet slashed with gold
(something between a king and a bandit), with uplifted face of terror
and drawn sword, calling the war of the elements &ldquo;tremendious,&rdquo; was
to me a greater potentate than the world could almost contain! The
young lady, his daughter, in ringlets and spangles, who came flying on
in the midst of the storm, and fell at his feet, with upraised arms and a
piteous appeal, &ldquo;Alas! my father, and will you not consent to my
marriage with Alphonso?&rdquo; seemed more lovely to me than the Sultanas
in the &ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; or the Princesses in Fairyland. I sat there
entranced and speechless. A new world had opened to me&mdash;a world of
delight. For weeks and weeks afterwards, that play, with its wondrous
beauties, its shifting scenes, was present to me sleeping and waking.</p>

<p>The ladies in spangles, the gentlemen in slashed doublets, were on
the platforms of their respective shows to-day, dancing for the benefit
of Pitchcroft. Now and again a set would leave off, the music ceasing
also, to announce that the performance was about to commence. I
am not sure but I should have gone up to see one, but for the presence
of Tod and Harry Parker&mdash;whom we had met on the course. There
were learned pigs, and spotted calves, and striped zebras; and gingerbread
and cake stalls; and boat-swings and merry-go-rounds&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
had made me frightfully sick once when Hannah let me go in one.
And there was the ever-increasing throng, augmenting incessantly;
carriages, horsemen, shoals of foot-passengers; conjurers and fortune-tellers;
small tables for the game of &ldquo;thimble-rig,&rdquo; their owners looking
out very sharply for the constables who might chance to be looking
for <em>them</em>; and the movable exhibitions of dancing dolls and Punch
and Judy. Ay, the sounds and the sights are in my brain now.
The bands of the different shows, mostly attired in scarlet and gold, all
blowing and drumming as hard as they could blow and drum; the
shouted invitations to the admiring spectators, &ldquo;Walk up, ladies and
gentlemen, the performance is just a-going to begin;&rdquo; the scraping of
the blind fiddlers; the screeching of the ballad-singers; the sudden
uproar as a stray dog, attempting to cross the course, is hunted off it;
the incessant jabber and the Babel of tongues; and the soft roll of
wheels on the turf.</p>

<p>Hark! The bell rings for the clearing of the course. People know
what it means, and those who are cautious hasten at once to escape
under the cords on either side. The gallop of a horse is heard, its
rider, in his red coat and white smalls, loudly smacking his whip to
effect the clearance. The first race is about to begin. All the world
presses towards the environs of the grand-stand to get a sight of the
several horses entered for it. Here they come; the jockeys in their
distinguishing colours, trying their horses in a brisk canter, after having
been weighed in the paddock. A few minutes, and the start is
effected; they are off!</p>

<p>It is only a two-mile heat. The carriages are all drawn up against
the cords; the foot-passengers press it; horsemen get where they can.
And now the excitement is at its height; the rush of the racers coming
in to the winning-post breaks on the ear. They fly like the wind.</p>

<p>At that moment I caught sight of the sharply eager face of a good-looking,
dashing man, got up to perfection&mdash;you might have taken him
for a lord at least. Arm-in-arm with him stood another, well-got-up
also, as a sporting country gentleman; he wore a green cut-away coat,
top-boots, and a broad-brimmed hat which shaded his face. If I say
&ldquo;got-up,&rdquo; it is because I knew the one, and I fancied I knew the other.
But the latter&rsquo;s face was partly turned from me, and hidden, as I have
said, by the hat. Both watched the swiftly-coming racehorses with ill-concealed
anxiety: and both, as well-got-up gentlemen at ease, strove
to appear indifferent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tod, there&rsquo;s Captain Bird.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Bird! Where? You are always fancying things, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few yards lower down. Close to the cords.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, be shot to the scoundrel, and so it is! What a swell! Don&rsquo;t
bother. Here they come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blue cap wins!&rdquo; &ldquo;No! red sleeves gains on him!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
stripes is first!&rdquo; &ldquo;Pink jacket has it!&rdquo; &ldquo;By Jove! the bay colt is
distanced!&rdquo; &ldquo;Purple wins by a neck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a hubbub of these different versions from the bystanders
echoing on our ears, the horses flew past in a rush and a whirl. Black
cap and white jacket was the winner.</p>

<p>Amidst the crowding and the pushing and the excitement that
ensued, I tried to get nearer to Captain Bird. Not to see <em>him</em>: it was
impossible to look at him with any patience and contrast his dashing
appearance with that of poor, faded Lucy&rsquo;s: but to see the other man.
For he put me in mind of the gentleman-detective Eccles, who had
loomed upon us at Crabb Cot that Sunday afternoon in the past winter,
polished off the sirloin of beef, crammed the Squire with anecdotes of
his college life, and finally made off with the other earring.</p>

<p>You can turn back to the paper called &ldquo;Mrs. Todhetley&rsquo;s Earrings,&rdquo;
and recall the circumstances. How she lost an earring out of her ear:
a pink topaz encircled with diamonds. It was supposed a tramp had
picked it up; and the Squire went about it to the police at Worcester.
On the following Sunday a gentleman called introducing himself as Mr.
Eccles, a private detective, and asking to look at the other earring.
The Squire was marvellously taken with him, ordered in the beef, not
long gone out from the dinner, and was as eager to entrust the earring
to him as he was to take it. That Eccles had been a gentleman once&mdash;at
least, that he had mixed with gentlemen, was easy to be seen:
and perhaps had also been an Oxford man, as he asserted; but he was
certainly a swindler now. He carried off the earring; and we had
never seen him, or it, from that day to this. But I did think I saw him
now on the racecourse. In the side face, and the tall, well-shaped
figure of the top-booted country gentleman, with the heavy bunch of
seals hanging from his watch-chain, who leaned on that man Captain
Bird&rsquo;s arm, there was a great resemblance to him. The other earring,
lost first, was found in the garden under a small fir-tree when the snow
melted away, where it must have dropped unseen from Mrs. Todhetley&rsquo;s
ear, as she stopped in the path to shake the snow from the tree.</p>

<p>But the rush of people sweeping by was too great. Captain Bird
and he were nowhere to be seen. In the confusion also I lost Tod and
Harry Parker. The country gentleman I meant to find if I could, and
went looking about for him.</p>

<p>The carriages were coming away from their standing-places near
the ropes to drive about the course, as was the custom in those days.
Such a thing as taking the horses out of a carriage and letting it stay
where it was until the end of the day was not known on Worcester
racecourse. You might count the carriages-and-four there then, their
inmates exchanging greetings with each other in passing, as they drove
to and fro. It was a sight to see the noblemen&rsquo;s turn-outs; the
glittering harness, the array of servants in their sumptuous liveries;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
for they came in style to the races. The meeting on the course was
the chief local event of the year, when all the county assembled to see
each other and look their best.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you get up now, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soft bowling of the Squire&rsquo;s carriage-wheels arrested itself, as
he drew up to speak to me. The Martley old gentleman sat with him,
and there was a vacant place by Giles behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, sir. I would rather be on foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you will, lad. Is your watch safe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Joe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somewhere about. He is with Harry Parker. I have only just
missed them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Missed them! Oh, and I suppose you are looking for them. A
capital race, that last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind you take care of yourself, Johnny,&rdquo; he called back, as he
touched up Bob and Blister, to drive on. I generally did take care of
myself, but the Squire never forgot to remind me to do it.</p>

<p>The afternoon went on, and my search with it in the intervals of the
racing. I could see nothing of those I wanted to see, or of Tod and
Harry Parker. Our meeting, or not meeting, was just a chance, amidst
those crowds and crowds of human beings, constantly moving. Three
o&rsquo;clock had struck, and as soon as the next race should be over&mdash;a
four-mile heat&mdash;it would be nearly time to think about keeping my
appointment with Lucy Bird.</p>

<p>And now once more set in all the excitement of the running. A
good field started for the four-mile heat, more horses than had run yet.</p>

<p>I liked those four-mile heats on Worcester racecourse: when we
watched the jockeys in their gay and varied colours twice round the
course, describing the figure of eight, and coming in, hot and panting,
at the end. The favourites this time were two horses named &ldquo;Swallower&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Master Ben.&rdquo; Each horse was well liked: and some
betters backed one, some the other. Now they are off!</p>

<p>The running began slowly and steadily; the two favourites just ahead;
a black horse (I forget his name, but his jockey wore crimson and
purple) hanging on to them; most of the other horses lying outside.
The two kept together all the way, and as they came in for the final
run the excitement was intense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swallower has it by a neck!&rdquo; &ldquo;No! Master Ben heads him!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ben wins! Swallower loses!&rdquo; &ldquo;Swallower has it! Ben&rsquo;s jockey is
beat!&rdquo; and so on, and so on. Amidst the shouts and the commotion
the result was announced&mdash;a dead heat.</p>

<p>So the race must be run again. I looked at my watch (which you
may be sure I had kept carefully buttoned up under my jacket),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
wondering whether I could stay for it. That was uncertain; there was
no knowing how long an interval would be allowed for breathing-time.</p>

<p>Suddenly there arose a frightful commotion above all the natural
commotion of the course. People rushed towards one point; horsemen
galloped thither, carriages bowled cautiously in their wake. The
centre of attraction appeared to be on the banks of the river, just
beyond the grand-stand. What was it? What had occurred? The
yells were deafening; the pushing fearful. At last the cause was
known: King Mob was ducking some offender in the Severn.</p>

<p>To get near, so as to see anything of the fun, was impossible; it was
equally impossible to gather what he had done; whether picked a
pocket, or cheated at betting. Those are the two offences that on
Pitchcroft were then deemed deserving of the water. This time, I
think, it was connected with betting.</p>

<p>Soon the yells became louder and nearer. Execrations filled the air.
The crowd opened, and a wretched-looking individual emerged out of it
on the hard run, his clothes dripping, his hair hanging about his face
like rat&rsquo;s tails.</p>

<p>On he came, the mob shouting and hallooing in his wake, and
brushed close past me. Why! it was surely the country gentleman I
had seen with Bird! I knew him again at once. But whether it was
the man Eccles or not, I did not see; he tore by swiftly, his head kept
down. A broad-brimmed hat came flying after him, propelled by the
feet of the crowd. He stooped to catch it up, and then kept on his way
right across the course, no doubt to make his escape from it. Yes, it
was the same man in his top-boots. I was sure of that. Scampering
close to his heels, fretting and yelling furiously, was a half-starved
white dog with a tin kettle tied to its tail. I wondered which of the
two was the more frightened&mdash;the dog or the man.</p>

<p>And standing very nearly close to me, as I saw then, was Captain
Bird. Not running, not shouting; simply looking on with a countenance
of supreme indifference, that seemed to express no end of languid
contempt of the fun. Not a sign of recognition crossed his face as the
half-drowned wight swept past him: no one could have supposed he
ever set eyes on him before. And when the surging crowd had passed,
he sauntered away in the direction of the saddling-place.</p>

<p>But I lost the race. Though I stayed a little late, hoping to at last
see the horses come out for the second start, and to count how many of
the former field would compete for it, the minutes flew all too swiftly
by, and I had to go, and to put the steam on. Making a bolt across
Pitchcroft and up Salt Lane, went I, full split, over the Tything, and
so down to Sansome Walk. St. Oswald&rsquo;s clock was tinkling out four
as I reached it.</p>

<p>Lucy did not come. She had indicated the spot where the meeting
should be; and I waited there, making the best I could of it; cooling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
myself, and looking out for her. At half-past four I gave her up in my
own mind; and when five o&rsquo;clock struck, I knew it was useless to stay
longer. So I began to take my way back slower than I had come; and
on turning out by St. Oswald&rsquo;s, I saw the carriages and people flocking
up on their way from Pitchcroft. The first day&rsquo;s racing was over.</p>

<p>There was a crowd at the top of Salt Lane, and I had to wait before
I could get across. In the wake of a carriage-and-four that was turning
out of it came Captain Bird, not a feather of his plumage ruffled, not
a speck (except dust) on his superfine coat, not a wristband soiled. He
had not been ducked, if his friend had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, Master Ludlow?&rdquo; said he, with a grandly patronizing
air, and a flourish of his cane, as if it were a condescension to notice me.
And I answered him civilly; though he must have been aware I knew
what a scamp he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d steal away to America some moonlight night,&rdquo; ran my
thoughts, &ldquo;and leave poor Lucy in peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire&rsquo;s carriage dashed up to the hotel as I reached it, Tod
sitting behind with Giles. I asked which of the two horses had won.
Swallower: won by half-a-neck. The Squire was in a glow of satisfaction,
boasting of the well-contested race.</p>

<p>And now, to make things intelligible, I must refer again for a minute
or two to that past paper. It may be remembered that when &ldquo;Detective
Eccles&rdquo; called on us that Sunday afternoon, asking to look at the
fellow-earring to the one lost, Mrs. Todhetley had gone in to the
Coneys&rsquo;, and the Squire sent me for her. When I arrived there, Lucy
Bird was in the drawing-room alone, the mater being upstairs with
Mrs. Coney. Poor Lucy told me she had been spending a day or two
at Timberdale Court (her happy childhood&rsquo;s home), and had come over
to dine with Mr. and Mrs. Coney, who were always kind to her, she
added with a sigh; but she was going back to Worcester by the next
train. I told her what I had come for&mdash;of the detective&rsquo;s visit and his
request to see the other earring. Mrs. Todhetley felt nervous at meeting
a real live detective, and asked me no end of questions as to what
this particular one was like. I said he was no tiger to be afraid of, and
described him as well as I could: a tall, slender, gentlemanly man, well-dressed;
gold studs, a ring on his finger, a blue necktie, and a black
moustache. Lucy (I had noticed at the time) seemed struck with the
description; but she made no remark. Before we turned in at our
gate we saw her leave the Coneys&rsquo; house, and come stepping through
the snow on her way to the station. Since then, until now, we had not
seen anything of Lucy Bird.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>The stars flickered through the trees in Sansome Walk as I turned
into it. A fine trouble I had had to come! Some entertainment was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
in full swing that evening at the Saracen&rsquo;s Head&mdash;a sort of circus, combined
with rope-dancing. Worcester would be filled with shows during
the race-week (I don&rsquo;t mean those on Pitchcroft), and we went to as
many as we could get money for. We had made the bargain with
Harry Parker on the course to go to this one, and during the crowded
dinner Tod asked the Squire&rsquo;s leave. He gave it with the usual injunctions
to take care of ourselves, and on condition that we left our
watches at home. So, there I was in a fix; neither daring to say at
the dinner-table that I could not go, nor daring to say what prevented
it, for Lucy had bound me to secrecy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time is this thing going to be over to-night, Joe?&rdquo; had
questioned the Squire, who was drinking port wine with some more old
gentlemen at one end of the table, as we rose to depart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Tod. &ldquo;About ten o&rsquo;clock, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, mind you come straight home, you two. I won&rsquo;t have you
getting into mischief. Do you hear, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What mischief do you suppose, sir, we are likely to get into?&rdquo;
fired Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the Squire. &ldquo;When I was a young lad&mdash;younger
than you&mdash;staying here for the races with my father&mdash;but we
stayed at the Hop-pole, next door, which was the first inn then&mdash;I
remember we were so wicked one night as to go about ringing and
knocking at all the doors&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and your father, sir?&rdquo; asked Tod, innocently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father! no!&rdquo; roared the Squire. &ldquo;What do you mean, Joe?
How dare you! My father go about the town knocking at doors and
ringing at bells! How dare you suggest such an idea! We left my
father, sir, at the hotel with his friends at their wine, as you are leaving
me with my friends here now. It was I and half-a-dozen other young
rascals who did it&mdash;more shame for us. I can&rsquo;t be sure how many bell-wires
we broke. The world has grown wiser since then, though I don&rsquo;t
think it&rsquo;s better; and&mdash;and mind you walk quietly home. Don&rsquo;t get
into a fight, or quarrel, or anything of that kind. The streets are sure
to be full of rough people and pickpockets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry Parker was waiting for us in the hotel gateway. He said he
feared we should be late, and thought we must have been eating dinner
for a week by the time we took over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not coming with you, Tod,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll join you presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod turned round and faced me. &ldquo;What on earth&rsquo;s that for,
Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing. I&rsquo;ll come soon. You two go on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose you don&rsquo;t get a place!&rdquo; cried Parker to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I shall get one fast enough: it won&rsquo;t be so crowded as all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, look here, lad,&rdquo; said Tod, with his face of resolution; &ldquo;you
are up to some dodge. What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My head aches badly,&rdquo; I said&mdash;and that was true. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go
into that hot place until I have had a spell of fresh air. But I shall be
sure to join you later, if I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My headaches were always allowed. I had them rather often. Not
the splitting, roaring pain that Tod would get in his head on rare occasions,
once a twelvemonth, or so, when anything greatly worried him;
but bad enough in all conscience. He said no more; and set off with
Harry Parker up the street towards the Saracen&rsquo;s Head.</p>

<p>The stars were flickering through the trees in Sansome Walk, looking
as bright as though it were a frosty night in winter. It was cool
and pleasant: the great heat of the day&mdash;which must have given me
my headache&mdash;had passed. Mrs. Bird was already at the spot. She
drew me underneath the trees on the side, looking up the walk as
though she feared she had been followed. A burst of distant music
crashed out and was borne towards us on the air: the circus band, at
the Saracen&rsquo;s Head. Lucy still glanced back the way she had come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid of anything, Lucy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no danger, I believe,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but I cannot help
being timid: for, if what I am doing were discovered, I&mdash;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
know what they would do to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not come this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I was very sorry, but I could not,&rdquo; she said, as we paced
slowly about, side by side. &ldquo;I had my shawl and bonnet on, when
Edwards came in&mdash;a friend of my husband&rsquo;s, who is staying with him.
He had somehow got into the Severn, and looked quite an object, his
hair and clothes dripping wet, and his forehead bruised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Lucy, he was ducked!&rdquo; I cried excitedly. &ldquo;I saw it all.
That is, I saw the row; and I saw him when he made his escape across
Pitchcroft. He had on a smart green cut-away coat, and top-boots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I was sure it was something of that kind.
When my husband came home later they were talking together in an
undertone, Edwards cursing some betting-man, and Captain Bird telling
Edwards that it was his own fault for not being more cautious. However,
I could not come out, Johnny, though I knew you were waiting
for me. Edwards asked, as impertinently as he dared, where I was off
to. To buy some tea, I answered, but that it did not matter particularly,
as I had enough for the evening. They think I have come
out to buy it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say, Lucy, that Captain Bird denies you free
liberty?&mdash;watches you as a cat does a mouse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; you must not take up wrong notions of my husband,
Johnny Ludlow. Bad though the estimation in which he is held by
most people is, he has never been really unkind to me. Trouble,
frightful trouble he does bring upon me, for I am his wife and have to
share it, but personally unkind to me he has never yet been.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I should think it unkind in your place, if I could not go out
when I pleased, without being questioned. What do they suspect you
would be after?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not Captain Bird; it is Edwards. As to what he suspects, I
am sure he does not know himself; but he seems to be generally suspicious
of every one, and he sees I do not like him. I suppose he lives
in general fear of being denounced to the police, for he is always doing
what he calls &lsquo;shady&rsquo; things; but he must know that he is safe with
us. I heard him say to my husband the day before we left London,
&lsquo;Why do you take your wife down?&rsquo; Perhaps he thinks my brothers
might be coming to call on me, and of course he does not want attention
drawn to the place he may chance to be located in, whether here or
elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is his name, Lucy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name? Edwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Eccles, is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She glanced quickly round as we walked, searching my face in the
dusk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, when I first saw him to-day on the racecourse with Captain
Bird, he put me in mind of the fine gentleman who came to us that
Sunday at Crabb Cot, calling himself Detective Eccles, and carried off
Mrs. Todhetley&rsquo;s other earring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bird looked straight before her, making no answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> must remember that afternoon, Lucy. When I ran over to
old Coney&rsquo;s for Mrs. Todhetley, you were there, you know; and I told
you all about the earrings and the detective officer, then making his
dinner of cold beef at our house while he waited for the mother to come
home and produce the earring. Don&rsquo;t you remember? You were just
going back to Worcester.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still she said not a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucy, I think it is the same man. Although his black moustache
is gone, I feel sure it is he. The face and the tall slender figure are
just like his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How singular!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in a low tone to herself. &ldquo;How
strangely things come about!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But <em>is</em> it Eccles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny Ludlow,&rdquo; she said, catching my arm, and speaking in an
excited, breathless whisper, &ldquo;if you were to bring harm on me&mdash;that
is, on him or on my husband through me, I should pray to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you need not be afraid. Goodness me, Lucy! don&rsquo;t you know
that I wouldn&rsquo;t bring harm on any one in the world, least of all on
you? Why, you said to me this morning that I was true as steel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she said, bursting into tears. &ldquo;We have always been
good friends, have we not. Johnny, since you, a little mite of a child in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
a tunic and turned-down frill, came to see me one day at school, a
nearly grown-up young lady, and wanted to leave me your bright
sixpence to buy gingerbread? Oh, Johnny, if all people were only as
loyal and true-hearted as you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, Lucy, why need you doubt me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not see the shadows of those leaves playing on the ground
cast by the light of that gas-lamp?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Just as many
shadows, dark as those, lie in the path of my life. They have taught
me to fear an enemy where I ought to look for a friend; they have
taught me that life is so full of unexpected windings and turnings, that
we know not one minute what new fear the next may bring forth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Lucy, you need not fear me. I have promised you to say
nothing of having met you here; and I will say nothing, or of what
you tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Promise it me again, Johnny. Faithfully.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just a shade of vexation crossed me that she should think it needful
to reiterate this; but I would not let my face or voice betray it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise it again, Lucy. Faithfully and truly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever since last winter I have wanted to hold communication with
one of you at your home, and to restore something that had been lost.
But it had to be done very, very cautiously, without bringing trouble
on me or on any one connected with me. Many a solitary hour, sitting
by myself in our poor lodgings in London, have I deliberated whether
I might venture to restore this, and how it was to be done: many a
sleepless night have I passed, dwelling on it. Sometimes I thought I
would send it anonymously by the post, but it might have been stolen
by the way; sometimes it would occur to me to make a parcel of it
and despatch it in that way. I never did either. I waited until some
chance should bring me again near Mrs. Todhetley. But to-day I saw
that it would be better to trust you. She is true also, and kind; but
she might not be able to keep the secret from the Squire, and he&mdash;he
would be sure to betray it, though perhaps not intentionally, to all
Timberdale, and there&rsquo;s no knowing what mischief might come of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Light flashed upon me as she spoke. As surely as though it were
already before me in black and white, I knew what she was about to
disclose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucy, it is the lost earring! The man staying with you <em>is</em>
Eccles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she whispered in extreme terror, for a footstep suddenly
sounded close to us. Lucy glided behind the tree we were passing,
which in a degree served to hide her. How timid she was!&mdash;what
induced it?</p>

<p>The intruder was a shop-boy with an apron on, carrying a basket
of grocery parcels to one of the few houses higher up. He turned his
head and gave us a good stare, probably taking us for a pair of lovers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
enjoying a stolen ramble by starlight. Setting up a shrill whistle, he
passed on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what has come to me lately; my heart seems to beat
at nothing,&rdquo; said poor Mrs. Bird, coming from behind the tree with her
hand to her side. &ldquo;And it was doubly foolish of me to go <em>there</em>;
better that I had kept quietly walking on with you, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <em>is</em> it that you are afraid of, Lucy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only of their seeing me; seeing me with you. Were they to do
so, and it were to come out that the earring had been returned, they
would know I had done it. They suspected me at the time&mdash;at least,
Edwards did. For it is the earring I am about to restore to you,
Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She put a little soft white paper packet in my hand, that felt as if it
had wool inside it. I hardly knew whether I was awake or asleep.
The beautiful earring that we had given up for good, come back again!
And the sound of the drums and trumpets burst once more upon our
ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will give it to Mrs. Todhetley when you go home, Johnny.
And I must leave it to your discretion to tell her what you think proper
of whence you obtained it. Somewhat of course you must tell her,
but how much or how little I leave with you. Only take care you
bring no harm upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure, Lucy, that Mrs. Todhetley may be trusted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. Both of you must be secret as the grave. It is for my
sake, tell her, that I implore it. Perhaps she will keep the earring by
her for a few months, saying nothing, so that this visit of ours into
Worcestershire may be quite a thing of the past, and no suspicion, in
consequence of it, as connected with the earring, may arise in my
husband&rsquo;s mind. After that, when months have elapsed, she must
contrive to let it appear that the earring is then, in some plausible way
or other, returned to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rely upon it, we will take care. It will be managed very easily.
But how did you get the earring, Lucy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been in my possession ever since the night of the day you
lost it; that Sunday afternoon, you know. I have carried it about with
me everywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean carried it upon you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder you never lost it&mdash;a little thing like this!&rdquo; I said, touching
the soft packet that lay in my jacket pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not lose it,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;It was sewn into my clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Lucy, how did you manage to get it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave me the explanation in a few low, rapid words, glancing
about her as she did it. Perhaps I had better repeat it in my own way;
and to do that we must go back to the Sunday afternoon. At least,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
that will render it more intelligible and ship-shape. But I did not
learn one-half of the details then; no, nor for a long time afterwards.
And so, we go back again in imagination to the time of that January
day, when we were honoured by the visit of &ldquo;Detective Eccles,&rdquo; and
the snow was lying on the ground, and Farmer Coney&rsquo;s fires were
blazing hospitably.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lucy Bird quitted the warm fires and her kind friends, the Coneys,
and followed us out&mdash;me and Mrs. Todhetley&mdash;she saw us turn in at
our own gate, and then she picked her way through the snow to the
station at South Crabb. It was a long walk for her in that inclement
weather; but she had been away from home (if the poor lodgings they
then occupied in Worcester could be called home) two days, and was
anxious to get back again. During her brief absences from it, she was
always haunted by the fear of some ill falling on that precious husband
of hers, Captain Bird; but he was nothing but an ex-captain, as you
know. All the way to the station she was thinking about the earrings,
and of my description of Detective Eccles. The description was exactly
that of her husband&rsquo;s friend, Edwards, both as to person and dress; not
that she supposed it could be he. When she left Worcester nearly two
days before, Edwards had just arrived. She knew him to be an educated
man, of superior manners, and full of anecdote, when he chose, about
college life. Like her husband, he had, by recklessness and ill-conduct,
sunk lower and lower in the world, until he had to depend on &ldquo;luck&rdquo;
or &ldquo;chance&rdquo; for a living.</p>

<p>Barely had Lucy reached the station, walking slowly, when the train
shot in. She took her seat; and, after a short halt the train moved on
again. At that moment there strode into the station that self-same
man, Edwards, who began shouting furiously for the train to stop,
putting up his hands, running and gesticulating. The train declined to
stop; trains generally do decline to stop for late passengers, however
frantically adjured; and Edwards was left behind. His appearance
astonished Lucy considerably. Had he, in truth, been passing himself
off as a detective officer to Squire Todhetley? If so, with what motive?
Lucy could not see any motive, and still thought it could not be; that
Edwards must be over here on some business of his own. The matter
passed from her mind as she drew near Worcester, and reached their
lodgings, which were down Lowesmoor way.</p>

<p>Experience had taught Lucy not to ask questions. She was either
not answered at all, or the answer would be sure to give her trouble.
Captain Bird had grown tolerably careless as to whether his hazardous
doings reached, or did not reach, the ears of his wife, but he did not
willingly tell her of them. She said not a word of having seen Edwards,
or of what she had heard about the loss of Mrs. Todhetley&rsquo;s earring, or
of the detective&rsquo;s visit to Crabb Cot. Lucy&rsquo;s whole life was one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
dread and fear, and she never knew whether any remark of hers might
not bear upon some dangerous subject. But while getting the tea, she
did just inquire after Edwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Edwards left?&rdquo; she asked carelessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Captain Bird, who was stretched out before the fire in
his slippers, smoking a long pipe, and drinking spirits. &ldquo;He is out on
the loose, though, somewhere, to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was late at night when Edwards entered. He was in a rage.
Trains did not run frequently on Sundays, and he had been kept all
that time at South Crabb Junction, waiting for one. Lucy went upstairs
to bed, leaving Edwards and her husband drinking brandy-and-water.
Both of them had had quite enough already.</p>

<p>The matter of the earrings and the doubt whether Mr. Edwards had
been playing at amateur detectiveship would have ended there, but for
the accident of Lucy&rsquo;s having to come downstairs again for the small
travelling-bag in which she had carried her combs and brushes. She
had put it just inside the little back parlour, where a bed on chairs had
been extemporized for Edwards, their lodgings not being very extensive.
Lucy was picking up the bag in the dark, when some words in
the sitting-room caught her ear; the door between the two rooms being
partly open. Before a minute elapsed she had heard too much.
Edwards, in a loud, gleeful, boasting tone, was telling how he had been
acting the detective, and done the old Squire and his wife out of the
other earring. Lucy, looking in through the opening, saw him holding
it up; she saw the colours of the long pink topaz, and the diamonds
flash in the candle-light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought I could relieve them of it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I read that
advertisement in the paper, it struck me there might be a field open to
do a little stroke of business; and I&rsquo;ve done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a fool for your pains,&rdquo; growled Captain Bird. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
sure to be a row.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The row won&rsquo;t touch me. I&rsquo;m off to London to-morrow morning,
and the earring with me. I wonder what the thing will turn us in?
Twenty pounds. There, put it in the box, Bird, and get out the
dice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dice on a Sunday night!</p>

<p>Lucy felt quite sick as she went back upstairs. What would be the
end of all this? Not of this one transaction in particular, but of all the
other disgraceful transactions with which her husband was connected?
It might come to some public exposure, some criminal trial at the Bar
of Justice; and of that she had a horrible dread ever haunting her like
a nightmare.</p>

<p>She undressed, and went to bed. One hour passed, two hours
passed, three hours passed. Lucy turned and turned on her uneasy
pillow, feeling ready to die. Besides her own anguish arising from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
<em>their</em> share in it, she was dwelling on the shameful wrong it did their
kind friends at Crabb Cot.</p>

<p>The fourth hour was passing. Captain Bird had not come up, and
Lucy grew uneasy on that score. Once, when he had taken too much
(but as a general rule the ex-captain&rsquo;s delinquencies did not lie in that
direction), he had set his shirt-sleeve on fire, and burnt his hands badly
in putting it out. Slipping out of bed, Lucy put on her slippers and
the large old shawl, and crept down to see after him.</p>

<p>Opening the sitting-room door very softly, she looked in. The
candles were alight still, but had burnt nearly down to the socket; the
dice and some cards were scattered on the table.</p>

<p>Edwards lay at full length on the old red stuff sofa; Captain Bird had
thrown himself outside the bed in the other room, the door of which
was now wide open, neither of them having undressed. That both
were wholly or partially intoxicated, Lucy felt not a doubt of.</p>

<p>Well, she could only leave them as they were. They would come
to no harm asleep. Neither would the candles: which must soon burn
themselves out. Lucy was about to shut the door again, when her eye
fell on the little pasteboard box that contained the earring.</p>

<p>Without a moment&rsquo;s reflection, acting on the spur of impulse, she
softly stepped to the table, lifted the lid, and took the earring out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will remedy the wrong they have done Mrs. Todhetley,&rdquo; she said
to herself. &ldquo;They will never suspect me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Up in her room again, she lighted her candle and looked about for
some place to conceal the earring; and, just as the idea to secure it
had come unbidden to her, so did that of a safe place of concealment.
With feverish hands she undid a bit of the quilting of her petticoat,
one that she had but just made for herself out of an old merino gown,
slipped the earring into the wadding, and sewed it up again. It could
neither be seen nor suspected there; no, nor even felt, let the skirt
be examined as it might. That done, poor Lucy went to bed again
and at length fell asleep.</p>

<p>She was awakened by a commotion. It was broad daylight, and her
husband (not yet as sober as he might be) was shaking her by the arm.
Edwards was standing outside the door, calling out to know whether
Mrs. Bird had &ldquo;got it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, George?&rdquo; she cried, starting up in a fright,
and for the moment completely forgetting where she was, for she had
been aroused from a vivid dream of Timberdale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been bringing anything up here from the sitting-room,
Lucy?&rdquo; asked Captain Bird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, nothing,&rdquo; she replied promptly, and he saw that she spoke
with truth. For Lucy&rsquo;s recollection had not come to her; she remembered
nothing yet about the earring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something missing,&rdquo; said Captain Bird, speaking thickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It has disappeared mysteriously off the sitting-room table. You are
sure you have not been down and collared it, Lucy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The earring and the theft&mdash;her own theft&mdash;flashed into her memory
together. Oh, if she could only avert suspicion from herself! And she
strove to call up no end of surprise in her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how could I have been down, George? Did you not see
that I was fast asleep? What have you missed? Some money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Money, no. It was&mdash;something of Edwards&rsquo;s. Had it close by
him on the table when he went to sleep, he says&mdash;he lay on the sofa
last night, and I had his bed&mdash;and this morning it was gone. I thought
the house was on fire by the way he came and shook me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look for it when I come down, if you tell me what it is,&rdquo; said
poor Lucy. &ldquo;How late I have slept! It must have been the cold
journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has not got it,&rdquo; said Captain Bird, retreating to his friend
outside, and closing the door on Lucy. &ldquo;Knows nothing about it.
Was asleep till I awoke her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Search the room, you fool,&rdquo; cried the excited Edwards. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
never trust the word of a woman. No offence to your wife, Bird, but
it is <em>not</em> to be trusted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; said Captain Bird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Either she or you must have got it. It could not disappear without
hands. The people down below have not been to our rooms, as you
must know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She or I&mdash;what do you mean by that?&rdquo; retorted Captain Bird;
and a short sharp quarrel ensued. That the captain had not touched
the earring, Edwards knew full well. It was Edwards who had helped
him to reach the bed the previous night: and since then Bird had been
in the deep sleep of stupor. But Edwards did think the captain&rsquo;s wife
had. The result was that Captain Bird re-entered; and, ordering Lucy
to lie still, he made as exact a search of the room as his semi-sobered
faculties allowed. Lucy watched it from her bed. Amidst the general
hunting and turning-over of drawers and places, she saw him pick up
her gown and petticoats one by one and shake them thoroughly, but
he found no signs of the earring.</p>

<p>From that time to this the affair had remained a mystery. There
had been no one in the house that night, except the proprietor and his
wife, two quiet old people who never concerned themselves with their
lodgers. They protested that the street-door had been fast, and that
no midnight marauder could have broken in and slipped upstairs to
steal a pearl brooch (as Edwards put it) or any other article. So,
failing other sources of suspicion, Edwards continued to suspect Lucy.
There were moments when Bird did also: though he trusted her, in
regard to it, on the whole. At any rate, Lucy was obliged to be most
cautious. The quilted skirt had never been off her since, except at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
night: through the warm genial days of spring and the sultry heat of
summer she had worn the clumsy wadded thing constantly: and the
earring had never been disturbed until this afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see how it is, Johnny,&rdquo; she said to me, with one of her long-drawn
sighs.</p>

<p>But at that moment the grocer&rsquo;s young man in the white apron came
back down the walk, swinging his empty basket by the handle; and he
took another good stare at us in passing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean as to the peril I should be in if you suffer the restoration of
the earring to transpire,&rdquo; she continued in a whisper, when he was at a
safe distance. &ldquo;Oh, Johnny Ludlow! do you and Mrs. Todhetley take
care, for my poor sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucy, you need not doubt either of us,&rdquo; I said earnestly. &ldquo;We
will be, as you phrased it to-day, true as steel&mdash;and as cautious. Are
you going back? Let me walk up to the top with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; we part here. Seeing us together might arouse some
suspicion, and there is no absolute certainty that they may not come
out, though I don&rsquo;t think they will. Edwards is for ever thinking of
that earring: he does not feel safe about it, you perceive. Go you
that way: I go this. Farewell, Johnny Ludlow; farewell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Lucy. I am off to the circus now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went with a brisk step up the walk. I ran out by St. Oswald&rsquo;s,
and so on to the Saracen&rsquo;s Head. The place was crammed. I could
not get near Tod and Harry Parker; but they whistled at me across
the sawdust and the fancy steeds performing on it.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>We sat together in Mrs. Todhetley&rsquo;s bedroom at Dyke Manor, the
door bolted against intruders: she, in her astonishment at the tale I
told, hardly daring to touch the earring. It was Saturday morning;
we had come home from Worcester the previous evening; and should
now be off to school in an hour. Tod had gone strolling out with the
Squire; which gave me my opportunity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, good mother, how it all is, and the risk we run. Do you
know, I had half a mind to keep the earring myself for some months
and say never a word to you; only I was not sure of pitching on a safe
hiding-place. It would be so dreadful a thing for Lucy Bird if it were
to get known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Lucy, poor Lucy!&rdquo; she said, the tears on her light eyelashes.
&ldquo;Oh, Johnny, if she could only be induced to leave that man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she can&rsquo;t, you know. Robert Ashton has tried over and over
again to get her back to the Court&mdash;and tried in vain. See how it
glitters!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was holding the earring so that the rays of the sun fell upon it,
flashing and sparkling. It seemed more beautiful than it used to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very, very glad to have it back, Johnny; the other was
useless without it. You have not,&rdquo; with a tone of apprehension in her
voice, &ldquo;told Joseph?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shook my head. The truth was, I had never longed to tell anything
so much in my life; for what did I ever conceal from him? It
was hard work, I can assure you. The earring burning a hole in my
pocket, and I not able to show Tod that it was there!</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, mother, where will you put it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose to unlock a drawer, took from it a small blue box in the
shape of a trunk, and unlocked that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is in this that I keep all my little valuables, Johnny. It will be
quite safe here. By-and-by we must invent some mode of &lsquo;recovering
the earring,&rsquo; as poor Lucy said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lifting the lid of a little pasteboard box, she showed me the fellow-earring,
lying in a nest of cotton. I took it out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put them both into your ears for a minute, good mother! Do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled, hesitated; then took out the plain rings that were in
her ears, and put in those of the beautiful pink topaz and diamonds.
Going to the glass to look at herself, she saw the Squire and Tod
advancing in the distance. It sent us into a panic. Scuffling the
earrings out of her ears, she laid them together on the wool in the
cardboard box, put the lid on, and folded it round with white paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light one of the candles on my dressing-table, Johnny. We will
seal it up for greater security: there&rsquo;s a bit of red sealing-wax in the
tray.&rdquo; And I did so at her direction: stamping it with the seal that
had been my father&rsquo;s, and which with his watch they had only recently
allowed me to take into wearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;should any one by chance see that packet,
though it is not likely, and be curious to know what it contains, I shall
say that I cannot satisfy them, as it concerns Johnny Ludlow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you upstairs, Johnny? What in the world are you doing
there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went leaping down at Tod&rsquo;s call. All was safe now.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how the other earring came back. And &ldquo;Eccles&rdquo; had to be
let off scot free. But I was glad he had the ducking.</p>

<h3>Part the First.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with <em>you</em>?&rdquo; cried the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matter enough,&rdquo; responded old Coney, who had come hobbling
into our house, and sat down with a groan. &ldquo;If you had the gout in
your great toe, Squire, as I have it in mine, you&rsquo;d soon feel what the
matter was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been grunting over that gout for days past, Coney!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I have. It won&rsquo;t go in and it won&rsquo;t come out; it stops there
on purpose to torment me with perpetual twinges. I have been over
to Timberdale Parsonage this morning, and the walk has pretty nigh
done for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire laughed. We often did laugh at Coney&rsquo;s gout: which
never seemed to be very bad, or to get beyond incipient &ldquo;twinges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better have stayed at home and nursed your gout than have
pranced off to Timberdale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I had to go,&rdquo; said the farmer. &ldquo;Jacob Lewis sent for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Coney spoke of Parson Lewis, Rector of Timberdale. At this
time the parson was on his last legs, going fast to his rest. His mother
and old Coney&rsquo;s mother had been first cousins, which accounted for the
intimacy between the parsonage and the farm. It was Eastertide, and
we were spending it at Crabb Cot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember Thomas Lewis, the doctor?&rdquo; asked old Coney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember him! ay, that I do,&rdquo; was the Squire&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;What
of him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has been writing to the parson to take a house for him; he and
his daughter are coming to live in old England again. Poor Lewis
can&rsquo;t look out for one himself, so he has put it upon me. And much I
can get about, with this lame foot!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;A house at Timberdale?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Either in the neighbourhood of Timberdale or Crabb, Dr. Lewis
writes: or he wouldn&rsquo;t mind Islip. I saw his letter. Jacob says there&rsquo;s
nothing vacant at Timberdale at all likely to suit. We have been
thinking of that little place over here, that the people have just gone
out of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What little place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maythorn Bank. &rsquo;Twould be quite large enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s very pretty,&rdquo; added the Squire. &ldquo;Thomas Lewis coming
back! Wonders will never cease. How he could reconcile himself to
staying away all his life, I can&rsquo;t tell. Johnny lad, he will like to see
you. He and your father were as thick as inkle weavers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay! Ludlow was a good friend to him while he was doing
nothing,&rdquo; nodded old Coney. &ldquo;As to his staying away, I expect he
could not afford to live in England. He has had a legacy left him
now, he tells the parson. What are you asking, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I ever know Dr Lewis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not you, lad. Thomas Lewis went abroad ages before you were
born, or thought of. Five-and-twenty years he must have been away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than that,&rdquo; said the Squire.</p>

<p>This Thomas Lewis was half-brother to the Rector of Timberdale,
but was not related to the Coneys. He served his time, when a boy, to a
surgeon at Worcester. In those days young men were apprenticed to
doctors just as they were to other trades. Young Lewis was steady
and clever; but so weak in health that when he was qualified and
ought to have set up on his own account, he could not. People were
wondering what would become of him, for he had no money, when by
one of those good chances that rarely fail in time of need, he obtained
a post as travelling companion to a nobleman, rich and sickly, who was
going to reside in the warmth of the south of France. They went. It
brought up Thomas Lewis&rsquo;s health well; made quite another man of
him; and when, a little later, his patron died, he found that he had
taken care of his future. He had left the young surgeon a competency
of two hundred a-year. Mr. Lewis stayed on where he was, married
a lady who had some small means, took a foreign medical degree to
become Dr. Lewis, and obtained a little practice amidst the English
that went to the place in winter. They had been obliged to live
frugally, though an income of from two to three hundred a-year goes
a great deal farther over the water than it does in England: and perhaps
the lack of means to travel had kept Dr. Lewis from visiting his
native land. Very little had been known of him at home; the letters
interchanged by him and the parson were few and far between. Now,
it appeared, the doctor had again dropped into a legacy of a few
hundred pounds, and was coming back with his daughter&mdash;an only
child. The wife was dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>Maythorn Bank, the pretty little place spoken of by Mr. Coney, was
taken. It belonged to Sir Robert Tenby. A small, red-brick house,
standing in a flower-garden, with a delightful view from its windows of
the charming Worcestershire scenery and the Malvern Hills in the
distance. Excepting old Coney&rsquo;s great rambling farm-homestead close
by, it was the nearest house to our own. But the inside, when it came
to be looked at, was found to be in a state of dilapidation, not at all fit
for a gentleman&rsquo;s habitation. Sir Robert Tenby was applied to, and he
gave directions that it should be put in order.</p>

<p>Before this was completed, the Rector of Timberdale died. He had
been suffering from ailments and sorrow for a long while; and in the
sweet spring season, the season that he had loved above all other
seasons, when the May birds were singing and the May flowers were
blooming, he crossed the river that divides us from the eternal shores.</p>

<p>Mr. Coney had to see to the new house then upon his own responsibility;
and when it was finished and the workmen were gone out of
it, he went over to Worcester, following Dr. Lewis&rsquo;s request, and ordered
in a sufficiency of plain furniture. By the middle of June all was ready,
a maid-servant engaged, and the doctor and his daughter were at liberty
to come when they pleased.</p>

<p>We had just got home for the Midsummer holidays when they arrived.
Old Coney took me to the station to meet them; he said there might be
parcels to carry. Once, a French lady had come on a visit to the farm,
and she brought with her fifteen small hand-packages and a bandbox.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And these people are French, too, you see, Johnny,&rdquo; reasoned old
Coney. &ldquo;Lewis can&rsquo;t be called anything better, and the girl was born
there. Can&rsquo;t even speak English, perhaps. I&rsquo;m sure he has had time
to forget his native tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But they spoke English just as readily and fluently as we did; even
the young lady, Anne, had not the slightest foreign accent. And there
were no small packages; nothing but three huge trunks and a sort of
large reticule, which she carried herself, and would not give up to me.
I liked her looks the moment I saw her. You know I always take
likes or dislikes. A rather tall girl, light and graceful, with a candid
face, a true and sweet voice, and large, soft brown eyes that met mine
frankly and fearlessly.</p>

<p>But the doctor! He was like a shadow. A tall man, with stooping
shoulders, handsome, thin features, hollow cheeks, and scanty hair.
But every look and movement bespoke the gentleman; every tone of
his low voice was full of considerate courtesy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a poor weak fellow!&rdquo; lamented old Coney aside to me.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the Thomas Lewis of the years gone by; no health, no
stamina. I&rsquo;m afraid he has only come home to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They liked the house, and liked everything in it; and he thanked old
Coney very earnestly for the trouble he had taken. I never saw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
man, as I learnt later, so considerate for the feelings of others, or so
grateful for any little service rendered to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is delightful,&rdquo; said Miss Lewis, smiling at me. &ldquo;I shall call it
our little château. And those hills in the distance are the beautiful
Malvern Hills that my father has so often told me of!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How well you speak English!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Just as we do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose I could do otherwise, when my father and my
mother were English? It is in truth my native tongue. I think I
know England better than France. I have always heard so much of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you speak French as a native?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course. German also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I see you are an accomplished young lady, Miss Lewis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am just the opposite,&rdquo; she said, with a laugh. &ldquo;I never learnt
accomplishments. I do not play; I do not sing; I do not draw; I do
not&mdash;but yes, I do dance: every one dances in France. Ours was not
a rich home, and my dear mother brought me up to be useful in it. I
can make my own dresses; I can cook you an omelette, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anne, this is Mr. Todhetley,&rdquo; interrupted her father.</p>

<p>The Squire had come in through the open glass doors, round which
the jessamine was blooming. When they had talked a bit, he took me
up to Dr. Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Coney told you who he is? William Ludlow&rsquo;s son. You
remember <em>him</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember William Ludlow! I must forget myself before I could
forget him,&rdquo; was the doctor&rsquo;s answer, as he took both my hands in his
and held me before him to look into my eyes. The tears were rising
in his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pleasant face to look at,&rdquo; he was pleased to say. &ldquo;But they
did not name him William?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. We call him Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One generation passes away and another rises up in its place. How
few, how few of those I knew are now left to welcome me! Even poor
Jacob has not stayed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tears seemed to be the fashion just then. I turned away, when
released, and saw them in Miss Lewis&rsquo;s eyes as she stood against the
window-sill, absently playing with the white jessamine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When they begin to speak of those who are gone, it always puts
me in mind of mamma,&rdquo; she said in a whisper, as if she would apologize
for the tears. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it long since you lost her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearly two years; and home has not been the same to papa since.
I do my best; but I am not my mother. I think it was that which
made papa resolve to come to England when he found he could afford
it. Home is but triste, you see, when the dearest one it contained has
gone out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>It struck me that the house could not have had one dearer in it than
Anne. She was years and years older than I, but I began to wish she
was my sister.</p>

<p>And her manners to the servant were so nice&mdash;a homely country girl,
named Sally, engaged by Mr. Coney. Miss Lewis told the girl that she
hoped she would be happy in her new place, and that she would help
her when there was much work to do. Altogether Anne Lewis was a
perfect contrast to the fashionable damsels of that day, who could not
make themselves appear too fine.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday. We had just finished breakfast, and
Mrs. Todhetley was nursing her toothache, when Dr. Lewis came in,
looking more shadowy than ever in his black Sunday clothes, with the
deep band on his hat. They were going to service at Timberdale, and
he wanted me to go with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I have not forgotten the way to Timberdale,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;but there&rsquo;s an odd, shy feeling upon me of not liking to walk about
the old place by myself. Anne is strange to it also. We shall soon
get used to it, I dare say. Will you go, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crabb Church is close by, Lewis,&rdquo; remarked the Squire, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s
a steaming hot day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must go to Timberdale this morning. It was poor Jacob&rsquo;s
church, you know for many years. And though he is no longer there,
I should like to see the desk and pulpit which he filled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, to be sure,&rdquo; readily acquiesced the Squire. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d go with you
myself, Lewis, but for the heat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Lewis said he should take the roadway, not the short cut through
Crabb Ravine. It was a good round, and we had to start early. I
liked Anne better than ever: no one could look nicer than she did in
her trim black dress. As we walked along, Dr. Lewis frequently halted
to recognize old scenes, and ask me was it this place, or that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That fine place out yonder?&rdquo; he cried, stopping to point to a large
stone house half-a-mile off the road, partly hidden amidst its beautiful
grounds. &ldquo;I ought to know whose it is. Let me see!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Sir Robert Tenby&rsquo;s seat&mdash;Bellwood. Your landlord, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, to be sure&mdash;Bellwood. In my time it was Sir George&rsquo;s,
though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir George died five or six years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Sir Robert any family? He must be middle-aged now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he is forty-five, or so. He is not married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he chiefly live here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About half his time; the rest he spends at his house in London,
He lives very quietly. We all like Sir Robert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We sat in the Rector&rsquo;s pew, having it to ourselves. Herbert
Tanerton did the duty, and gave a good sermon. Nobody was yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
appointed to the vacant living, which was in Sir Hubert Tenby&rsquo;s gift.
Herbert, meanwhile, took charge of the parish, and many people thought
he would get it&mdash;as he did, later.</p>

<p>The Bellwood pew faced the Rector&rsquo;s, and Sir Robert sat in it alone.
A fine-looking man, with greyish hair, and a homely face that you
took to at once. He seemed to pay the greatest attention to Herbert
Tanerton&rsquo;s sermon; possibly was deliberating whether he was worthy
of the living, or not. In the pew behind him sat Mrs. Macbean, an
old lady who had been housekeeper at Bellwood during two generations;
and the Bellwood servants sat further down.</p>

<p>We were talking to Herbert Tanerton outside the church after
service, when Sir Robert came up and spoke to the parson. He,
Herbert, introduced Dr. Lewis to him as the late Rector&rsquo;s brother.
Sir Robert shook hands with him at once, smiled pleasantly at Anne,
and nodded to me as he continued his way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like your house?&rdquo; asked Herbert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall like it by-and-by, no doubt,&rdquo; was the doctor&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;I
should like it now, but for the paint. The smell is dreadful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that will soon go off,&rdquo; cried Herbert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I hope so: or I fear it will make me ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In going back we took Crabb Ravine, and were at home in no time.
They asked me to stay dinner, and I did so. We had a loin of lamb,
and a raspberry tart, if any one is curious to know. Dr. Lewis had
taken a fancy to me: I don&rsquo;t know why, unless it was that he had
liked my father; and I&rsquo;m sure I had taken one to them. But the
paint did smell badly, and that&rsquo;s the truth.</p>

<p>In all my days I don&rsquo;t think I ever saw a man so incapable as Dr.
Lewis; so helpless in the common affairs of life. What he would
have done without Anne, I know not. He was just fit to sit down and
be led like a child; to have said to him&mdash;Come here, go there; do
this, do the other. Therefore, when he asked me to run in in the
morning and see if he wanted anything, I was not surprised. Anne
thought he might be glad of my shoulder to lean upon when he walked
about the garden.</p>

<p>It was past eleven when I arrived there, for I had to do an errand
first of all for the Squire. Anne was kneeling down in the parlour
amidst a lot of small cuttings of plants, which she had brought from
France. They lay on the carpet on pieces of paper. She wore a
fresh white cotton gown, with black spots upon it, and a black bow at
the throat; and she looked nicer than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Johnny; I don&rsquo;t know what to do. The labels have
all come off, and I can&rsquo;t tell which is which. I suppose I did not
fasten them on securely. Sit down&mdash;if you can find a chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chairs and tables were strewed with books, most of them French,
and other small articles, just unpacked. I did not want a chair, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
knelt down beside her, asking if I could help. She said no, and that
she hoped to be straight by the morrow. The doctor had stepped out,
she did not know where, &ldquo;to escape the smell of the paint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was deep in the pages of one of the books, &ldquo;Les Contes de Ma
Bonne,&rdquo; which Anne said was a great favourite of hers, though it was
meant for children; and she had her head, as before, bent over the
green sprigs and labels, when a shadow, passing the open glass doors,
glanced in and halted. I supposed it must be the doctor; but it was
Sir Robert Tenby. Up I started; Anne did the same quietly, and
quietly invited him in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I walked over to see Dr. Lewis, and to ask whether the house
requires anything else done to it,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;And I had to come
early, as I am leaving the neighbourhood this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;it is very kind of you to come. Will
you please to sit down, sir?&rdquo; hastily taking the books off a chair.
&ldquo;Papa is out, but I think he will not be long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you satisfied with the house?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so, sir; and I do not think it wants anything done to it at
all. I hope you will not suppose we shall keep it in this state,&rdquo; she
added rather anxiously. &ldquo;When things are being unpacked, the
rooms are sure to look untidy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Robert smiled. &ldquo;You seem very notable, Miss Lewis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do everything,&rdquo; she answered, smiling back. &ldquo;There is no
one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had not taken the chair, but went out, saying he should probably
meet Dr. Lewis&mdash;leaving a message for him, about the house, in case
he did not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is your great and grand man of the neighbourhood, is he not,
Johnny?&rdquo; said Anne, as she knelt down on the carpet again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is grand enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t you think he is, considering that fact, very pleasant
and affable? I&rsquo;m sure he is as simple and free in manners and speech
as we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most grand men&mdash;if they are truly great&mdash;are that. Your upstarts
assume no end of airs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know who will never assume airs, Johnny. He has none in him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It made me laugh. I had nothing to assume them for.</p>

<p>It was either that afternoon or the following one that Dr. Lewis
came up to the Squire and old Coney as they were talking together in
the road. He told them that he could not possibly stay in the house;
he should be laid up if he did; he must go away until the smell of the
paint was gone. That he was looking ill, both saw; and they believed
he did not complain without cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>The question was, where could he go? Mr. Coney hospitably
offered him house-room; but the doctor, while thanking him, said the
smell might last a long time, and he should prefer to be independent.
He had been thinking of going with Anne to Worcester for a time.
Did they know of lodgings there?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better go to an hotel,&rdquo; said the Squire. &ldquo;No trouble at an hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But hotels are not always comfortable. I cannot feel at home in
them,&rdquo; argued the poor doctor. &ldquo;And they cost too much besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might chance to hit upon lodgings where you wouldn&rsquo;t be any
more comfortable, Lewis. And they&rsquo;d be very dull for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Lake&rsquo;s boarding-house,&rdquo; put in old Coney, whilst the
doctor was looking blank and helpless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A boarding-house? Ay, that might do, if it&rsquo;s not a noisy one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not noisy at all,&rdquo; cried the Squire. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s uncommonly well
conducted: sometimes there are not three visitors in the house. You
and Miss Lewis would be comfortable there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And for Lake&rsquo;s boarding-house Dr. Lewis and Anne took their departure
on the very next day. If they had only foreseen the trouble their
stay at it would lead to!</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Lake&rsquo;s boarding-house stood near the cathedral. A roomy house,
with rather shabby furniture in it: but in boarding-houses and lodgings
people don&rsquo;t, as a rule, look for gilded chairs and tables. Some years
before, Mrs. Lake, the wife of a professional man, and a gentlewoman,
was suddenly left a widow with four infant children, boys, and nothing
to keep them upon. What to do she did not know. And it often
puzzles me to think what such poor ladies <em>do</em> do, left in similar straits.</p>

<p>She had her furniture; and that was about all. Friends suggested
that she should take a house in a likely situation, and try for some lady
boarders; or perhaps for some of the college boys, whose homes lay at
a distance. Not to make too long a story of it, it was what she did do.
And she had been in the house ever since, struggling on (for these
houses mostly do entail a struggle), sometimes flourishing in numbers,
sometimes down in the dumps with empty rooms. But she had
managed to bring the children up: the two elder ones were out in the
world, the two younger were still in the college school. Mrs. Lake was
a meek little woman, ever distracted with practical cares, especially as
to stews and gravies: Miss Dinah Lake (her late husband&rsquo;s sister, and
a majestic lady of middle age), who lived with her, chiefly saw to the
company.</p>

<p>But now, would any one believe that Dr. Lewis was &ldquo;that shy,&rdquo; as
their maid, Sally, expressed it&mdash;or perhaps you would rather call it
helpless&mdash;that he begged the Squire to let me go with him to Lake&rsquo;s.
Otherwise he should be lost, he said; and Anne, accustomed to French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
ways and habits, could not be of much use to him in a strange boarding-house:
Johnny knew the house, and would feel at home there.</p>

<p>When Captain Sanker and his wife (if you have not forgotten them)
first came to Worcester, they stayed at Lake&rsquo;s while fixing on a residence,
and that&rsquo;s how we became tolerably well acquainted with the
Lakes. This year that I am now writing about was the one that preceded
the accident to King Sanker, told of earlier in the volume. And,
in point of rotation, this paper ought to have appeared first.</p>

<p>So I went with Dr. Lewis and Anne. It was late in the afternoon
when we reached Worcester, close upon the dinner-hour&mdash;which was
five o&rsquo;clock, and looked upon as quite a fashionable hour in those days.
The dinner-bell had rung, and the company had filed in to dinner when
we got downstairs.</p>

<p>But there was not much company staying in the house. Mrs. Lake
did not appear at dinner, and Miss Dinah Lake took the head of the
table. It happened more often than not that Mrs. Lake was in the
kitchen, superintending the dinner and seeing to the ragouts and
sauces; especially upon the advent of fresh inmates, when the fare
would be unusually liberal. Mrs. Lake often said she was a &ldquo;born
cook;&rdquo; which was lucky, as she could not afford to keep first-rate
servants.</p>

<p>Miss Dinah sat at the head of the table, in a rustling green gown and
primrose satin cap. Having an income of her own she could afford to
dress. (Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s best gown was black silk, thin and scanty.) Next to
Miss Dinah sat a fair, plump little woman, with round green eyes and a
soft voice: at any rate, a soft way of speaking: who was introduced to
us as Mrs. Captain Podd. She in turn introduced her daughters, Miss
Podd and Miss Fanny Podd: both fair, like their mother, and with the
same sort of round green eyes. A Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell completed
the company; two silent people who seemed to do nothing but eat.</p>

<p>Dr. Lewis sat by Mrs. Captain Podd: and very pleasant and attentive
the doctor found her. He was shy as well as helpless; but she talked
to him freely in her low soft voice and put him altogether at his ease.
My place chanced to be next to Miss Fanny Podd&rsquo;s: and she began
at once to put me at my ease, as her mother was putting the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a stranger here, at the dinner-table,&rdquo; observed Miss
Fanny; &ldquo;but we shall be good friends presently. People in this house
soon become sociable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not quite hear your name. Did you catch mine? Fanny
Podd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Thank you. Mine is Ludlow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you never were at Worcester before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know Worcester very well indeed. I live in Worcestershire.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; cried the young lady, neglecting her soup to stare at me,
&ldquo;we heard you had just come over from living in France. Miss Dinah
said so&mdash;that old guy at the head of the table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. and Miss Lewis have just come from France. Not I. I know
Miss Dinah Lake very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you? Don&rsquo;t go and tell her I called her an old guy. Mamma
wants to keep in with Miss Dinah, or she might be disagreeable. What
a stupid town Worcester is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you do not know many people in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know any one. We had been staying last in a garrison
town. That was pleasant: so many nice officers about. You could
not go to the window but there&rsquo;d be some in sight. Here nobody seems
to pass but a crew of staid old parsons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are near the cathedral; that&rsquo;s why you see so many parsons.
Are you going to remain long in Worcester?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just as the fancy takes mamma. We have been here
already six or seven weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you no settled home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Fanny Podd pursed up her lips and shook her head. &ldquo;We
like change best. A settled home would be wretchedly dull. Ours
was given up when papa died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus she entertained me to the end of dinner. We all left the table
together&mdash;wine was not in fashion at Lake&rsquo;s. Those who wanted any
had to provide it for themselves: but the present company seemed to
be satisfied with the home-brewed ale. Mrs. Captain Podd put her
arm playfully into that of Dr. Lewis, and said she would show him the
way to the drawing-room.</p>

<p>And so it went on all the evening: she making herself agreeable to
the doctor: Miss Podd to Anne; Fanny to me. Of course it was highly
good-natured of them. Mrs. Podd discovered that the doctor liked
backgammon; and she looked for a moment as cross as a wasp on finding
there was no board in the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite an omission, my dear Miss Dinah,&rdquo; she said, smoothing away
the frown with a sweet smile. &ldquo;I thought a backgammon-board was
as necessary to a house as chairs and tables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Lake had a board once,&rdquo; said Miss Dinah; &ldquo;but the boys got
possession of it, and somehow it was broken. We have chess&mdash;and
cribbage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like a hand at cribbage, my dear sir?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Podd of the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play it, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&rdquo;&mdash;with a little sigh. &ldquo;Julia, love, would you mind singing
one of your quiet songs? Or a duet. Fanny, sweetest, try a quiet
duet with your sister. Go to the piano.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If they called the duet quiet, I wondered what they called noisy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
You might have heard it over at the cathedral. Their playing and
singing was of the style known as &ldquo;showy.&rdquo; Some people admire it:
but it is a good thing ear-drums are not easily cracked.</p>

<p>The next day Mrs. Podd made the house a present of a backgammon-board:
and in the evening she and Dr. Lewis sat down to
play. Our number had decreased, for Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell had left;
and Mrs. Lake dined with us, taking the foot of the table. Miss Dinah
always, I found, kept the head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is so much better calculated to preside than I am,&rdquo; whispered
meek Mrs. Lake to me later in the evening; as, happening to pass the
kitchen-door after dinner, I saw her in there, making the coffee.
&ldquo;What should I do without Dinah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But need you come out to make the coffee, Mrs. Lake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, when I leave it to the servants, it is not drinkable. I am
rather sorry Mrs. Podd makes a point of having coffee in an evening.
Our general rule is to give only tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t give in to Mrs. Podd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, dear, we like to be accommodating when we can. Being my
cousin, she orders things more freely than our ladies usually do. Dinah
calls her exacting; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mrs. Podd your cousin?&rdquo; I interrupted, in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My first cousin. Did you not know it? Her mother and my
mother were sisters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The girls don&rsquo;t call you &lsquo;aunt.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They do sometimes when we are alone. I suppose they think I
am beneath them&mdash;keeping a boarding-house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had not much liked the Podds at first: as the days went on I liked
them less. They were not sincere: I was quite sure of it; Mrs. Podd
especially. But the manner in which she had taken Dr. Lewis under
her wing was marvellous. He began to think he could not move without
her: he was as one who has found a sheet-anchor. She took
trouble of all kinds from him: her chief aim seemed to be to make his
life pass pleasantly. She would order a carriage and take him for a
drive in it; she&rsquo;d parade the High Street on his arm; she sat with him
in the Green within the enclosure, though Miss Dinah told her one day
she had not the right of entrance to it; she walked him off to inspect
the monuments in the cathedral, and talked with him in the cloisters
of the old days when Cromwell stabled his horses there. After dinner
they would play backgammon till bed-time. And with it all, she was
so gay and sweet and gentle, that Dr. Lewis thought she must be a very
angel come out of heaven.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny, I don&rsquo;t like her,&rdquo; said Anne to me one day. &ldquo;She seems
to take papa completely out of my hands. She makes him feel quite
independent of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You like her as well as I do, Anne.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;This morning I found him in the drawing-room; alone, for a
wonder: he was gazing up in his abstracted way, as if wanting to discover
what the pinnacles of the cathedral were made of, which appear
to be so close, you know, from the windows of that room. &lsquo;Papa, you
are lonely,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Would you like to walk out?&mdash;or what would you
like to do?&rsquo; &lsquo;My dear, Mrs. Podd will see to it all,&rsquo; he answered;
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t trouble yourself; I am waiting for her.&rsquo; It is just as though he
had no more need of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne Lewis turned away to hide her wet eyelashes. For my part,
I thought the sooner Mrs. Captain Podd betook herself from Lake&rsquo;s
boarding-house, the better. It was too much of a good thing.</p>

<p>That same afternoon I heard some conversation not meant for me.
Behind the house was a square patch of ground called a garden, containing
a few trees and some sweet herbs. I was sitting on the bench
there, underneath the high, old-fashioned dining-room windows, thinking
how hot the sun was, wishing for something to do, and wondering
when Dr. Lewis meant to send me home. He and Mrs. Podd were
out together; Anne was in the kitchen, teaching Mrs. Lake some
mysteries of French cookery. Miss Dinah sat in the dining-room, in
her spectacles, darning table-cloths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, have you come in!&rdquo; I suddenly heard her say, as the door
opened. And it was Mrs. Podd&rsquo;s voice that answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sun is so very hot: poor dear Dr. Lewis felt quite ill. He
has gone up to his room for half-an-hour to sit quietly in the shade.
Where are my girls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Miss Dinah: and it struck me that
her tone of voice was rather crusty. &ldquo;Mrs. Podd, I must again ask
you when you will let me have some money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as I can,&rdquo; said Mrs. Podd: who seemed by the sound, to
have thrown herself upon a chair, and to be fanning her face with a
rustling newspaper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have said that for some weeks. When is the &lsquo;soon&rsquo;
to be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know I have been disappointed in my remittances. It is
really too hot for talking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that you say you have. But we cannot go on without
some money. The expenses of this house are heavy: how are they to
be kept up if our guests don&rsquo;t pay us? Indeed you must let me have
part of your account, if not all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sweet creature, the house is not yours,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
Podd, in her most honeyed accents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I manage it,&rdquo; said Miss Dinah, &ldquo;and am responsible for getting in
the accounts. You know that our custom is to be paid weekly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly, dear Miss Dinah. But I am sure that my cousin, Emma
Lake, would not wish to inconvenience me. I am indebted to her;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
not to you; and I will pay her as soon as I can. My good creature,
how <em>can</em> you sit stewing over that plain sewing this sultry afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am obliged to,&rdquo; responded Miss Dinah. &ldquo;We have not money
to spend on new linen: trouble enough, it is, I can assure you, to keep
the old decent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should get somebody to help me. That young woman, Miss
Lewis, might do it: she seems to have been used to all kinds of work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would shut that door: you have left it open,&rdquo; retorted
Miss Dinah: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like sitting in a draught, though it is hot. And
I must beg of you to understand, Mrs. Podd, that we really cannot
continue to keep you and your daughters here unless you can manage
to give us a little money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the shutting of the door and the silence that ensued, it was
apparent that Mrs. Podd had departed, leaving Miss Dinah to her
table-cloths. But now, this had surprised me. For, to hear Mrs.
Captain Podd and her daughters talk, and to see the way in which
they dressed, one could not have supposed they were ever at a fault for
ready-cash.</p>

<p>At the end of ten days I went home. Dr. Lewis no longer wanted
me: he had Mrs. Podd. And I think it must have been about ten
days after that, that we heard the doctor and Anne were returning.
The paint smelt still, but not so badly as before.</p>

<p>They did not come alone. Mrs. Podd and her two daughters
accompanied them to spend the day. Mrs. Podd was in a ravishing
new toilette; and I hoped Lake&rsquo;s boarding-house had been paid.</p>

<p>Mrs. Podd went into raptures over Maythorn Bank, paint and all.
It was the sweetest little place she had ever been in, she said, and
some trifling, judicious care would convert it into a paradise.</p>

<p>I know who had the present care; and that was Anne. They got
over about twelve o&rsquo;clock; and as soon as she had seen the ladies&rsquo;
things off, and they were comfortably installed in the best parlour, its
glass doors standing open to the fragrant flower-beds, she put on a big
apron in the kitchen and helped Sally with the dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Need you do it, Anne?&rdquo; I said, running in, having seen her
crumbling bread as I passed the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I must, Johnny. Papa bade me have a nice dinner served
to-day: and Sally is inexperienced, you know: she knows nothing
about the little dishes he likes. To tell you the truth,&rdquo; added Anne,
glancing meaningly into my eyes for a moment, &ldquo;I would rather be
cooking here than talking with them there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sorry to leave Worcester?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and no,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Sorry to leave Mrs. Lake and
Miss Dinah, for I like them both: glad to be at home again and to
have papa to myself. I shall not cry if we never see Mrs. Podd again.
Perhaps I am mistaken: and I&rsquo;m sure I did not think that the judging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
of others uncharitably was one of my faults; but I cannot help thinking
that she has tried to estrange papa from me. I suppose it is her way:
she cannot have any real wish to do it. However, she goes back
to-night, and then it will be over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is at Lake&rsquo;s now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one&mdash;except the Podds. I am sorry, for I fear they have some
difficulty to make both ends meet.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Was it over! Anne Lewis reckoned without her host.</p>

<p>I was running into Maythorn Bank the next morning, when I saw
the shimmer of Anne&rsquo;s white garden-bonnet and her morning dress
amidst the raspberry-bushes, and turned aside to greet her. She had a
basin in her hand, picking the fruit, and the hot tears were running
down her cheeks. Conceal her distress she could not; any attempt
would have been worse than futile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Johnny, she is going to marry him!&rdquo; cried she, with an
outburst of sobs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to marry him!&mdash;who? what?&rdquo; I asked, taking the basin
from her hand: for I declare that the truth did not strike me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>She</em> is. Mrs. Podd. She is going to marry papa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment she held her face against the apple-tree. The words
confounded me. More real grief I had never seen. My heart ached
for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think me selfish,&rdquo; she said, turning presently, trying to subdue
the sobs, and wiping the tears away. &ldquo;I hope I am not that: or undutiful.
It is not for myself that I grieve; indeed it is not; but for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I knew that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could only think it would be for his happiness! But oh, I fear
it will not be. Something seems to tell me that it will not. And if&mdash;he
should be&mdash;uncomfortable afterwards&mdash;miserable afterwards!&mdash;I
think the distress would kill me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it <em>true</em>, Anne? How did you hear it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>True!</em> Too true, Johnny. At breakfast this morning papa said,
&lsquo;We shall be dull to-day without our friends, Anne.&rsquo; I told him I
hoped not, and that I would go out with him, or read to him, or do
anything else he liked; and I reminded him of his small stock of choice
books that he used to be so fond of. &lsquo;Yes, yes, we shall be very dull,
you and I alone in this strange house,&rsquo; he resumed. &lsquo;I have been
thinking for some time we should be, Anne, and so I have asked that
dear, kind, lively woman to come to us for good.&rsquo; I did not understand
him; I did not indeed, Johnny; and papa went on to explain. &lsquo;You
must know that I allude to Mrs. Podd, Anne,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;When I saw
her so charmed with this house yesterday, and we were talking about
my future loneliness in it&mdash;and she lamented it, even with tears&mdash;one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
word led to another, and I felt encouraged to venture to ask her to
share it and be my wife. And so, my dear, it is all settled; and I
trust it will be for the happiness of us all. She is a most delightful
woman, and will make the sunshine of any home.&rsquo; I wish I could
think it,&rdquo; concluded Anne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; don&rsquo;t take the basin,&rdquo; I said, as she went to do so. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll finish
picking the raspberries. What are they for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pudding. Papa said he should like one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why could not Sally pick them? Country girls are used to the
sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sally is busy. Papa bade her clear out that room where our boxes
were put: we shall want all the rooms now. Oh, Johnny, I wish we
had not left France! Those happy days will never come again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was the doctor falling into his dotage? The question crossed my
mind. It might never have occurred to <em>me</em>; but one day at Worcester
Miss Dinah had asked it in my hearing. I felt very uncomfortable,
could not think of anything soothing to say to Anne, and went on
picking the raspberries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many do you want? Are these enough?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, looking at them. &ldquo;I must fill the basin up
with currants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were bending over a currant-bush, Anne holding up a branch
and I stripping it, when footsteps on the path close by made us both
look up hastily. There stood Sir Robert Tenby. He stared at the
distress on Anne&rsquo;s face, which was too palpable to be concealed, and
asked without ceremony what was amiss.</p>

<p>It was the last feather that broke the camel&rsquo;s back. These words
from a stranger, and his evident concern, put the finishing touch to
Anne&rsquo;s state. She burst into more bitter tears than she had yet shed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it any trouble that I can help you out of?&rdquo; asked Sir Robert, in
the kindest tones, feeling, no doubt, as sorry as he looked. &ldquo;Oh, my
dear young lady, don&rsquo;t give way like this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Touched by his sympathy, her heart seemed to open to him: perhaps
she had need of finding consolation somewhere. Drying her tears,
Anne told her story simply: commenting on it as she had commented
to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is for my father&rsquo;s sake that I grieve, sir; that I fear. I feel sure
Mrs. Podd will not make him really happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, we must hope for the best,&rdquo; spoke Sir Robert, who
looked a little astonished at hearing the nature of the grievance, and
perhaps thought Anne&rsquo;s distress more exaggerated than it need have
been. &ldquo;Dr. Lewis wrote to me last night about some alteration he
wants to make in the garden; I have come to speak to him about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alteration in the garden!&rdquo; mechanically repeated Anne. &ldquo;I have
heard nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>He passed into the house to the doctor. We picked on at the
currants, and then took them into the kitchen. Anne sat down on a
chair to strip them from their stalks. Presently we saw Sir Robert and
the doctor at one end of the garden, the latter drawing boundaries
round a corner with his walking-stick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know,&rdquo; exclaimed Anne. &ldquo;Yesterday Mrs. Podd suggested
that a summer-house in that spot would be a delightful improvement.
But I never, never could have supposed papa meant to act upon the
suggestion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just so. Dr. Lewis wished to erect a summer-house of wood and
trellis-work, but had not liked to do it without first speaking to his
landlord.</p>

<p>As the days went on, Anne grew to feel somewhat reassured. She
was very busy, for all kinds of preparations had to be made in the
house, and the wedding was to take place at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, perhaps, I took it up in a wrong light, Johnny,&rdquo; she said to
me one day, when I went in and found her sewing at some new
curtains. &ldquo;I hope I did. It must have been the suddenness of the
news, I suppose, and that I was so very unprepared for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean? In what wrong light?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one seems to think ill of it, or to foresee cause for apprehension.
I am so glad. I don&rsquo;t think I can ever much like her: but if she
makes papa happy, it is all I ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who has been talking about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herbert Tanerton for one. He saw Mrs. Podd at Worcester last
week, and thought her charming. The very woman, he said, to do
papa good; lively and full of resource. So it may all be for the
best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I should as soon have expected an invitation to the moon as to the
wedding. But I got it. Dr. Lewis, left to himself, was feeling helpless
again, and took me with him to Worcester on the eve of the happy
day. We put up at the Bell Hotel for the night; but Anne went direct
to Lake&rsquo;s boarding-house. I ran down there in the evening.</p>

<p>Whether an inkling of the coming wedding had got abroad, I can&rsquo;t
say; it was to be kept private, and had been, so far as any one knew;
but Lake&rsquo;s house was full, not a room to be had in it for love or money.
Anne was put in a sleeping-closet two yards square.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not our fault,&rdquo; spoke Miss Dinah, openly. &ldquo;We were keeping
a room for Miss Lewis; but on Monday last when a stranger came,
wanting to be taken in, Mrs. Podd told us Miss Lewis was going to the
hotel with her father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear love, I thought you were,&rdquo; chimed in Mrs. Podd, as she
patted Anne on the shoulder. &ldquo;I must have mis-read a passage in your
dear papa&rsquo;s letter, and so caught up the misapprehension. Never
mind; you shall dress in my room if your own is not large enough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
And I am sure all young ladies ought to be obliged to me, for the new
inmate is a delightful man. My daughters find him charming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The room is quite large enough, thank you,&rdquo; replied Anne, meekly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you approve of the wedding, Miss Dinah?&rdquo; I asked her later,
when we were alone in the dining-room. &ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Dinah, who was counting a lot of glasses on the sideboard that
the maid had just washed and brought in, counted to the end, and then
began upon the spoons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the only way we can keep our girls in check,&rdquo; observed she;
&ldquo;otherwise they&rsquo;d break and lose all before them. I know how many
glasses have been used at table, consequently how many go out to be
washed, and the girl has to bring that same number in, or explain the
reason why. As to the spoons, they get thrown away with the dishwater
and sometimes into the fire. If they were silver it would be all
the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you like the match, Miss Dinah?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny Ludlow,&rdquo; she said, turning to face me, &ldquo;we make a point
in this house of not expressing our likes and dislikes. Our position is
peculiar, you know. When people have come to years of discretion,
and are of the age that Mrs. Podd is, not to speak of Dr. Lewis&rsquo;s, we
must suppose them to be capable of judging and acting for themselves.
We have not helped on the match by so much as an approving word
or look: on the other hand, it has not lain in our duty or in our power
to retard it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which was, of course, good sense. But for all her caution, I fancied
she could have spoken against it, had she chosen.</p>

<p>A trifling incident occurred to me in going back to the Bell. Rushing
round the corner into Broad Street, a tall, well-dressed man, sauntering
on before me, suddenly turned on his heel, and threw away his cigar.
It caught the front of my shirt. I flung it off again; but not before it
had burnt a small hole in the linen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the smoker, in a courteous voice&mdash;and
there was no mistaking him for anything but a gentleman. &ldquo;I am
very sorry. It was frightfully careless of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is nothing; don&rsquo;t think about it,&rdquo; I answered, making off at
full speed.</p>

<p>St. Michael&rsquo;s Church stood in a nook under the cathedral walls: it is
taken down now. It was there that the wedding took place. Dr.
Lewis arrived at it more like a baby than a bridegroom, helpless and
nervous to a painful degree. But Mrs. Podd made up for his deficiencies
in her grand self-possession; her white bonnet and nodding feather
seemed to fill the church. Anne wore grey silk; Julia and Fanny Podd
some shining pink stuff that their petticoats could be seen through.
Poor Anne&rsquo;s tears were dropping during the service; she kept her head
bent down to hide them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Look up, Anne,&rdquo; I said from my place close to her. &ldquo;Take
courage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, indeed, Johnny,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I wish I could.
I&rsquo;m sure I wouldn&rsquo;t throw a damper on the general joy for the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wedding-party was a very small one indeed; just ourselves and
a stern-looking gentleman, who was said to be a lawyer-cousin of the
Podds, and to come from Birmingham. All the people staying at
Lake&rsquo;s had flocked into the church to look on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray take my arm. Allow me to lead you out. I see how deeply
you are feeling this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ceremony seemed to be over almost as soon as it was begun&mdash;perhaps
the parson, remembering the parties had both been married
before, cut it short. And it was in the slight bustle consequent upon
its termination that the above words, in a low, tender, and most
considerate tone, broke upon my ear. Where had I heard the voice
before?</p>

<p>Turning hastily round, I recognized the stranger of the night before.
It was to Anne he had spoken, and he had already taken her upon his
arm. Her head was bent still; the rebellious tears would hardly be
kept back; and a sweet compassion sat on every line of his handsome
features as he gazed down at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; I asked of Fanny Podd, as he walked forward with
Anne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Angerstyne&mdash;the most fascinating man I ever saw in my life.
The Lakes could not have taken him in, but for mamma&rsquo;s inventing
that little fable of Anne&rsquo;s going with old Lewis to the Bell. Trust
mamma for not letting us two girls lose a chance,&rdquo; added free-speaking
Fanny. &ldquo;I may take your arm, I suppose, Johnny Ludlow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And after a plain breakfast in private, which included only the
wedding-party, Dr. and Mrs. Lewis departed for Cheltenham.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<h3>Part the Second.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny, what can I do? What do you <em>think</em> I can do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the pretty grey silk that she had worn at her father&rsquo;s wedding, and
with a whole world of perplexity in her soft brown eyes, Anne Lewis
stood by me, and whispered the question. As soon as the bride and
bridegroom had driven off, Anne was to depart for Maythorn Bank,
with Julia and Fanny Podd; all three of them to remain there for the
few days that Dr. and Mrs. Lewis purposed to be away. But now, no
sooner had the sound of the bridal wheels died on our ears, and Anne
had suggested that they should get ready for their journey home, than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
the two young ladies burst into a laugh, and said, <em>Did</em> she think they
were going off to that dead-alive place! Not if they knew it. And,
giving her an emphatic nod to prove they meant what they said, they
waltzed to the other end of the room in their shining pink dresses to talk
to Mr. Angerstyne.</p>

<p>Consternation sat in every line of Anne&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I cannot go there
alone, or stay there alone,&rdquo; she said to me. &ldquo;These things are not
done in France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No: though Maythorn Bank was her own home, and though she was
as thoroughly English as a girl can be, it could not be done. French
customs and ideas did not permit it, and she had been brought up in
them. It was certainly not nice behaviour of the girls. They should
have objected before their mother left.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> don&rsquo;t know what you can do, Anne. Better ask Miss Dinah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not go with you, after the arrangements are made&mdash;and your
servant Sally is expecting you all!&rdquo; cried Miss Dinah Lake. &ldquo;Oh, you
must be mistaken,&rdquo; she added; and went up to talk to them. Julia
only laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to be buried alive at Maythorn Bank as long as mamma chooses
to stay away!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get either of us to do anything
of the kind, Miss Dinah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Podd&mdash;I mean Mrs. Lewis&mdash;will be back to join you there in
less than a week,&rdquo; said Miss Dinah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, will she, though! You don&rsquo;t know mamma. She may be off
to Paris and fifty other places before she turns her head homewards
again. Anne Lewis can go home by herself, if she wants to go: I and
Fanny mean to stay with you, Miss Dinah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Anne had to stay also. She sat down and wrote two letters: one
to Sally, saying their coming home was delayed; the other to Dr. Lewis,
asking what she was to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the gain is mine,&rdquo; observed Mr. Angerstyne. &ldquo;What would
the house have been without you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He appeared to speak to the girls generally. But his eyes and his
smile evidently were directed to Anne. She saw it too, and blushed.
Blushed! when she had not yet known him four-and-twenty hours.
But he was just the fellow for a girl to fall in love with&mdash;and no disparagement
to her to say so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; I that evening asked Miss Dinah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Mr. Angerstyne,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know much of him,
except that he is an independent gentleman with a beautiful estate in
Essex, and a fashionable man. I see what you are thinking, Johnny:
that it is curious a man of wealth and fashion should be staying at
Lake&rsquo;s boarding-house. But Mr. Angerstyne came over from Malvern
to see Captain Bristow, the old invalid, who keeps his room upstairs,
and when here the captain persuaded him to stay for a day or two, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
we could give him a room. That&rsquo;s how it was. Captain Bristow
leaves us soon, and I suppose Mr. Angerstyne will be leaving too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had expected to go home the following day; but that night up came
two of the young Sankers, Dan and King, and said I was to go and stay
a bit with them. Leave to do so was easily had from home; for just
as our school at old Frost&rsquo;s was reassembling, two boys who had stayed
the holidays were taken with bad throats, and we were not to go back
till goodness knew when. Tod, who was on a visit in Gloucestershire,
thought it would be Michaelmas.</p>

<p>Back came letters from Cheltenham. Mrs. Lewis told her girls they
might remain at Worcester if they liked. And Dr. Lewis wrote to
Anne, saying she must not go home alone; and he enclosed a note to
Mrs. Lake, asking her to be so kind as to take care of his daughter.</p>

<p>After that we had a jolly time. The Sankers and Lakes amalgamated
well, and were always at one another&rsquo;s houses. This does not apply
to Mrs. Lake and Miss Dinah: as Miss Dinah put it, they had no time
for gadding down to Sanker&rsquo;s. But Mr. Angerstyne (who had not left)
grew quite familiar there; the Sankers, who never stood on the slightest
ceremony, making no stranger of him. Captain Sanker discovered that
two or three former naval chums of his were known to Mr. Angerstyne;
one dead old gentleman in particular, who had been his bosom friend.
This was quite enough. Mr. Angerstyne had, so to say, the key of the
house given him, and went in and out of it at will.</p>

<p>Every one liked Mr. Angerstyne. And for all the pleasurable excursions
that now fell to our lot, we were indebted to him. Without being
ostentatious, he opened his purse freely; and there was a delicacy in his
manner of doing it that prevented its being felt. On the plea of wanting,
himself, to see some noted spot or place in the neighbourhood, he
would order a large post-carriage from the Star or the Crown, and
invite as many as it would hold to accompany him, and bring baskets
of choice fruit, or dainties from the pastry-cook&rsquo;s, to regale us on. Or
he would tell the Sankers that King looked delicate: poor lame King,
who was to die ere another year had flown. Down would come the
carriage, ostensibly to take King for a drive; and a lot of us reaped the
benefit. Mrs. Sanker was always of the party: without a chaperon, the
young ladies could not have gone. Generally speaking the Miss Podds
would come&mdash;<em>they</em> took care of that: and Anne Lewis always came&mdash;which
I think Mr. Angerstyne took care of. The golden page of life
was opening for Anne Lewis: she seemed to be entering on an Elysian
pathway, every step of which was strewn with flowers.</p>

<p>One day we went to Holt Fleet. The carriage came down to the
Sankers&rsquo; in the morning, Mr. Angerstyne in it, and the captain stepped
out of doors, his face beaming, to see the start. Once in a way he
would be of the party himself, but not often. Mr. Angerstyne handed
Mrs Sanker in, and then called out for me. I held back, feeling uncomfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
at being always taken, and knowing that Fred and Dan
thought me selfish for it. But it was of no use: Mr. Angerstyne had a
way of carrying out his own will.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get up on the box, Johnny,&rdquo; he said to me. And, close upon my
heels, wanting to share the box with me, came Dan Sanker. Mr.
Angerstyne pulled him back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not you, Dan. I shall take King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;King has been ever so many times&mdash;little wretch!&rdquo; grumbled Dan.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my turn. It&rsquo;s not fair, Mr. Angerstyne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, Dan, and Fred, and Toby, all the lot of you, shall have a
carriage to yourselves for a whole day if you like, but King goes with
me,&rdquo; said Mr. Angerstyne, helping the lad up.</p>

<p>He got in himself, took his seat by Mrs. Sanker, and the post-boy
touched up his horses. Mrs. Sanker, mildly delighted, for she liked
these drives, sat in her ordinary costume: a fancy shawl of some thick
kind of silk crape, all the colours of the rainbow blended into its pattern,
and a black velvet bonnet with a turned-up brim and a rose in it,
beneath which her light hair hung down in loose curls.</p>

<p>We stopped at Lake&rsquo;s boarding-house to take up the three girls; who
got in, and sat on the seat opposite Mrs. Sanker and Mr. Angerstyne:
and then the post-boy started for Holt Fleet. &ldquo;The place is nothing,&rdquo;
observed Captain Sanker, who had suggested it as an easy, pleasant
drive to Mr. Angerstyne; &ldquo;but the inn is comfortable, and the garden&rsquo;s
nice to sit or stroll in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We reached Holt Fleet at one o&rsquo;clock. The first thing Mr. Angerstyne
did was to order luncheon, anything they could conveniently give
us, and to serve it in the garden. It proved to be ham and eggs; first-rate;
we were all hungry, and he bade them keep on frying till further
orders. At which the girl who waited on us laughed, as she drew the
corks of some bottled perry.</p>

<p>I saw a bit of by-play later on. Strolling about to digest the ham
and eggs, some in one part of the grounds, which in places had a wild
and picturesque aspect, some in another, Mr. Angerstyne suddenly
seized Anne, as if to save her from falling. She was standing in that
high narrow pathway that is perched up aloft and looks so dangerous,
steadying herself by a tree, and bending cautiously forwards to look
down. The path may be gone now. The features of the whole place
may be altered; perhaps even done away with altogether; for I am
writing of years and years ago. He stole up and caught her by the
waist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Angerstyne!&rdquo; she exclaimed, blushing and starting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you going to take a leap?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;Would it kill me if I did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose I let you go&mdash;and send you over to try it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ah, he would not do that. He was holding her all too safely. Anne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
made an effort to free herself; but her eyelids drooped over her tell-tale
eyes, her conscious face betrayed what his presence was to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How beautiful the river is from this, as we look up it!&rdquo; she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Julia Podd rushed up to mar the harmony. Never does a fleeting
moment of this kind set in but somebody does mar it. Julia flirted
desperately with Mr. Angerstyne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Angerstyne, I have been looking for you everywhere. Mrs.
Sanker wants to know if you will take us for a row on the water. The
inn has a nice boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Sanker does!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;With pleasure. Are you
fond of the water, Miss Lewis?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne made no particular reply. She stood at a little distance now,
apparently looking at the view; but I thought she wanted to hide her
hot cheeks. Mr. Angerstyne caught her hand in his, playfully put his
other hand within Miss Julia&rsquo;s arm, and so piloted them down. Ah,
he might flirt back again with Julia Podd, and did; with Fanny also;
but it was not to them his thoughts were given.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on the water!&rdquo; said Mrs. Sanker, who was sitting under the
shade of the trees, repeating one of her favourite ballads to King in a
see-saw tone. &ldquo;<em>I!</em> Julia Podd must have misunderstood me. To
go on the water might be nice for those who would like it, I said. I
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you go?&rdquo; asked Mr. Angerstyne, turning to Anne.</p>

<p>Anne shook her head, confessing herself too much of a coward.
She had never been on any water in her life until when crossing over
from France, and never wished to be. And Mr. Angerstyne ungallantly
let the boat alone, though Julia and Fanny told him they
adored the water.</p>

<p>We sat down in the shade by Mrs. Sanker; some on the bench by
her side, some on the grass at her feet, and she recited for us the time-worn
ballad she had begun for King: just as the following year she
would recite things to us, as already told of, sitting on the floor beam
of the turret-room. It was called &ldquo;Lord Thomas.&rdquo; Should you like
to hear it?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how delightful these old ballads are!&rdquo; cried Anne, as Mrs.
Sanker finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Delightful!&rdquo; retorted Julia Podd. &ldquo;Why, they are full of queer
phrases and outrageous metre and grammar!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dears, it is, I suppose, how people wrote and spoke in those
old days,&rdquo; said Mrs. Sanker, who had given great force to every turn
of the song, and seemed to feel its disasters as much as though she had
been fair Ellen herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; put in Mr. Angerstyne. &ldquo;The world was not full of
learning then, as it is now, and we accept the language&mdash;ay and like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
it, too&mdash;as that of a past day. To me, these old ballads are wonderful:
every one has a life&rsquo;s romance in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that day at Holt Fleet, the only time I, Johnny Ludlow, ever
saw the place, lives in my memory as a romance now.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>As the days went on, there could be no mistake made by the one or
two of us who kept our eyes open. I mean, as to Mr. Angerstyne&rsquo;s
liking for Anne Lewis, and the reciprocal feelings he had awakened.
With her, it had been a case of love at first sight; or nearly so. And
that, if you may believe the learned in the matter, is the only love
deserving the name. Perhaps it had been so with him: I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Three parts of their time they talked together in French, for Mr.
Angerstyne spoke it well. And that vexed Julia and Fanny Podd;
who called themselves good French scholars, but who somehow failed
to understand. &ldquo;They talk so fast; they do it on purpose,&rdquo; grumbled
Fanny. At German Mr. Angerstyne was not apt. He spoke it a very
little, and Anne would laughingly correct his mistakes, and repeat the
German words slowly over, that he might catch the accent, causing us
no end of fun. That was Anne&rsquo;s time of day, as Fanny Podd expressed
it; but when it came to the musical evenings, Anne was nowhere. The
other two shone like stars then, and did their best to monopolize Mr.
Angerstyne.</p>

<p>That a fine gentleman, rich, and a man of the great world, should
stay dawdling on at a boarding-house, puzzled Miss Dinah, who knew
what was what. Of course it was no business of hers; she and Mrs.
Lake were only too glad to have one who paid so liberally. He would
run upstairs to sit with Captain Bristow; and twice a week he went to
Malvern, sometimes not getting back in time for dinner.</p>

<p>The college school had begun again, and I was back at Lake&rsquo;s. For
Tom and Alfred Lake, who had been away, were at home now: and
nothing would do but I must come to their house before I went home&mdash;to
which I was daily expecting a summons. As to the bride and
bridegroom, we thought they meant to remain away for good; weeks
had elapsed since their departure. No one regretted that: Julia and
Fanny Podd considered Maythorn Bank the fag-end of the world, and
hoped they might never be called to it. And Anne, living in the
Elysian Fields, did not care to leave them for the dreary land outside
their borders.</p>

<p>One evening we were invited to a tea-dinner at Captain Sanker&rsquo;s.
The Miss Podds persisted in calling it a soirée. It turned out to be
a scrambling sort of entertainment, and must have amused Mr. Angerstyne.
Biddy had poured the bowl of sweet custard over the meat
patties by mistake, and put salt on the open tartlets instead of sugar.
It seemed nothing but fun to us all. The evening, with its mistakes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
and its laughter, and its genuine hospitality, came to an end, and we
started to go home under the convoy of Mr. Angerstyne, all the Sanker
boys, except Toby, attending us. It was a lovely moonlight night;
Mrs. Lake, who had come in at the tail of the soirée to escort the girls
home, remarked that the moon was never brighter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, just look there!&rdquo; she exclaimed, as we turned up Edgar
Street, intending to take that and the steps homewards; &ldquo;the Tower
gates are open!&rdquo; For it was the custom to close the great gates of
Edgar Tower at dusk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know,&rdquo; cried Fred Sanker. &ldquo;The sub-dean gave a dinner
to-night; and the porter has left the gates wide for the carriages. Who
is good for a race round the green?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed that we all were, for the whole lot of us followed him in,
leaving Mrs. Lake calling after us in consternation. The old Tower
porter, thinking the Green was being charged by an army of ill-doers,
rushed out of his den, shouting to us to come back.</p>

<p>Much we heeded him! Counting the carriages (three of them)
waiting at the sub-dean&rsquo;s door, we raced onwards at will, some hither,
some thither. King went back to Mrs. Lake. The evening coolness
felt delicious after the hot and garish day; the moonlight brought out
the lights and shades of the queer old houses and the older cathedral.
Collecting ourselves together presently, at Fred Sanker&rsquo;s whoop, Mr.
Angerstyne and Anne were missing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gone to look at the Severn, I think,&rdquo; said Dan Sanker.
&ldquo;I heard him tell her it was worth looking at in the moonlight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, they were there. He had Anne&rsquo;s arm tucked up under his,
and his head bent over her that she might catch his whispers. They
turned round at hearing our footsteps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed we must go home, Mr. Angerstyne,&rdquo; said Julia Podd, who
had run down after me, and spoke crossly. &ldquo;The college clock is
chiming a quarter to eleven. There&rsquo;s Mrs. Lake waiting for us under
the Tower!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it so late?&rdquo; he answered her, in a pleasant voice. &ldquo;Time flies
quickly in the moonlight: I&rsquo;ve often remarked it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walking forward, he kept by the side of Julia; Anne and I followed
together. Some of the boys were shouting themselves hoarse from the
top of the ascent, wanting to know if we were lost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it all settled, Anne?&rdquo; I asked her, jestingly, dropping my voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is what settled?&rdquo; she returned. But she understood; for her face
looked like a rose in the moonlight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know. <em>I</em> can see, if the others can&rsquo;t. And if it makes you
happy, Anne, I am very glad of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Johnny, I hope&mdash;I hope no one else does see. But indeed you
are making more of it than it deserves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he say to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He has not <em>said</em> anything. So you see, Johnny, you may be quite
mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was all the same: if he had not said anything yet, there could be
no question that he meant soon to say it. We were passing the old
elm-trees just then; the moonlight, flickering through them on Anne&rsquo;s
face, lighted up the sweet hope that lay on it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I think if&mdash;if papa should not approve of it!&rdquo; she
whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he is sure to approve of it. One cannot help liking Mr. Angerstyne:
and his position is undeniable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sub-dean&rsquo;s dinner guests were gone, the three carriages bowling
them away; and the porter kept up a fire of abuse as he waited to
watch us through the little postern-door. The boys, being college
boys, returned his attack with interest. Wishing the Sankers good-night,
who ran straight down Edgar Street on their way home, we
turned off up the steps, and found Mrs. Lake standing patiently at her
door. I saw Mr. Angerstyne catch Anne&rsquo;s hand for a moment in his,
under cover of our entrance.</p>

<p>The morning brought news. Dr. and Mrs. Lewis were on their way
to Maythorn Bank, expected to reach it that evening, and the young
ladies were bidden to depart for it on the following day.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>A wonderful change had taken place in Dr. Lewis. If they had
doubted before whether the doctor was not falling into his dotage they
could not doubt longer, for he was decidedly <em>in</em> it. A soft-speaking,
mooning man, now; utterly lost in the shadow cast by his wife&rsquo;s
importance. She appeared to be smiling in face and gentle in accent
as ever, but she overruled every soul in the house: no one but herself
had a will in it. What little strength of mind he might have had, his
new bride had taken out of him.</p>

<p>Anne did not like it. Hitherto mistress of all things under her
father, she found herself passed over as a nonentity. She might not
express an opinion, or hazard a wish. &ldquo;My dear, <em>I</em> am here now,&rdquo;
Mrs. Lewis said to her once or twice emphatically. Anne was
deposed; her reign was over.</p>

<p>One little thing, that happened, she certainly did not like. Though
humble-minded, entirely without self-assertion, sweet-tempered and
modest as a girl should be, she did not like this. Mrs. Lewis sent out
invitations for dinner to some people in the neighbourhood, strangers
to her until then; the table was too full by one, and she had told Anne
that she could not sit down. It was too bad; especially as Julia and
Fanny Podd filled two of the more important places, with bunches of
fresh sweet-peas in their hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Mrs. Lewis had said to Anne in the morning, &ldquo;we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
have a French side-dish or two, and there&rsquo;s no one but you understands
the making of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether having to play the host was too much for him, or that he
did not like the slight put upon his daughter, before the dinner was
half over, the doctor fell asleep. He could not be roused from it.
Herbert Tanerton, who had sat by Mrs. Lewis&rsquo;s side to say grace,
thought it was not sleep but unconsciousness. Between them the
company carried him into the other room; and Anne, hastening to
send in her French dishes, ran there to attend upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope and trust there&rsquo;s nothing amiss with his heart,&rdquo; said old
Coney doubtfully, in the bride&rsquo;s ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Coney, his heart is as strong as mine&mdash;believe me,&rdquo;
affirmed Mrs. Lewis, flicking some crumbs off the front of her wedding-dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope it is, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; repeated Coney. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that blue
tinge round his lips.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went back to the dinner-table when Dr. Lewis revived. Anne
remained kneeling at his feet, gently chafing his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he cried, staring at her like a man bewildered.
&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear papa, you fell asleep over your dinner, and they could not
wake you. Do you feel ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; he asked, as if he were speaking out of a dream.
And she told him what she could. But she had not heard those
suspicious words of old Coney&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>It was some minutes yet before he got much sense into him, or
seemed fully to understand. He fell back in the chair then, with a
deep sigh, keeping Anne&rsquo;s hand in his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I get you anything, papa?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You had eaten
scarcely any dinner, they say. Would you like a little drop of brandy-and-water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why was not your dress ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dress!&rdquo; exclaimed Anne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said so to me, when I asked why you did not come to table.
Not made, or washed, or ironed; or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne felt rather at sea. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing the matter with my
dresses, papa,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But never mind them&mdash;or me. Will you
go back to dinner? Or shall I get you anything here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go back; I don&rsquo;t want anything,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;Go and finish yours, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have had mine,&rdquo; she said, with a faint blush. For indeed her
dinner had consisted of some bread-and-butter in the kitchen, eaten
over the French stew-pans. Dr. Lewis was gazing out at the trees, and
seemed to be in thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you stayed away from home rather too long, papa,&rdquo; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
suggested. &ldquo;You are not accustomed to travelling; and I think you
are not strong enough for it. You looked very worn when you first
came home; worn and ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I told her it did not do for me; but she
laughed. It was nothing but a whirl, you know. And I only want to
be quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very quiet here, dear papa, and you will soon feel stronger.
You shall sit out of doors in the sun of a day, and I will read to you.
I wish you would let me get you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, child. I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With his eyes still fixed on the outdoor landscape, he sat stroking
Anne&rsquo;s hand abstractedly. Nothing broke the silence, except the faint
rattle of knives and forks from the dining-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind, Anne, she made me do it,&rdquo; he suddenly exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Made you do what, papa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so, my dear, if I am not allowed to remedy it, and you feel
disappointed, you must think as lightly of it as you are able; and don&rsquo;t
blame me more than you can help. I&rsquo;ll alter it again if I can, be sure
of that; but I don&rsquo;t have a moment to myself, and at times it seems
that she&rsquo;s just my keeper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne answered soothingly that all he did must be right, but had no
time to say more, for Mr. Coney, stealing in on tip-toe from the dining-room,
came to see after the patient. Anne had not the remotest idea
what it was that the doctor alluded to; but she had caught up one idea
with dread of heart&mdash;that the marriage had not increased his happiness.
Perhaps had marred it.</p>

<p>Maythorn Bank did not suit Mrs. Lewis. Ere she had been two
weeks at it, she found it insufferably dull; not to be endured at any
price. There was no fashion thereabout, and not much visiting; the
neighbours were mostly simple, unpretending people, quite different
from the style of company met with in garrison towns and pump-rooms.
Moreover the few people who might have visited Mrs. Lewis, did not
seem to take to her, or to remember that she was there. This did not
imply discourtesy: Dr. Lewis and his daughter had just come into the
place, strangers, so to say, and people could not practically recollect all
at once that Maythorn Bank was inhabited. Where was the use of
dressing up in peacock&rsquo;s plumes if nobody came to see her? The
magnificent wardrobe, laid in during her recent honeymoon, seemed as
good as wasted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand this!&rdquo; emphatically cried Mrs. Lewis one day to her
daughters. And Anne, chancing to enter the room unexpectedly at
the moment, heard her say it, and wondered what it meant.</p>

<p>That same afternoon, Dr. Lewis had another attack. Anne found
him sitting beside the pear-tree insensible, his head hanging over the
arm of the bench. Travelling had not brought this second attack on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
that was certain; for no man could be leading a more quiet, moping life
than he was. Save that he listened now and then to some book, read
by Anne, he had no amusement whatever, no excitement; he might
have sat all day long with his mouth closed, for all there was to open it
for. Mrs. Lewis&rsquo;s powers of fascination, that she had exercised so
persistently upon him as Mrs. Podd, seemed to have deserted her for
good. She passed her hours gaping, sleeping, complaining, hardly
replying to a question of his, if he by chance asked her one. Even the
soft sweet voice that had charmed the world mostly degenerated now
into a croak or a scream. Those very mild, not-say-boo-to-a-goose
voices are sometimes only kept for public life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall take you off to Worcester,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Lewis to him, when
he came out of his insensibility. &ldquo;We will start as soon as breakfast&rsquo;s
over in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Lewis began to tremble. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go to Worcester,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;I want to stay here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But staying here is not good for you, my dear. You&rsquo;ll be better at
Mrs. Lake&rsquo;s. It is the remains of this paint that is making you ill. I
can smell it still quite strongly, and I decidedly object to stay in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, you can go; I shall not wish to prevent you. But, as to
the paint, I don&rsquo;t smell it at all now. You can all go. Anne will take
care of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Dr. Lewis, do you think I would leave you behind me?
It <em>is</em> the paint. And you shall see a doctor at Worcester.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said he was a doctor himself, and did not need another; he once
more begged to be left at home in peace. All in vain: Mrs. Lewis
announced her decision to the household; and Sally, whose wits had
been well-nigh scared away by the doings and the bustle of the new
inmates, was gladdened by the news that they were about to take their
departure.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Pourtant si le ciel nous protège,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peut-être encore le reverrai-je.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>These words, the refrain of an old French song, were being sung by
Anne Lewis softly in the gladness of her heart, as she bent over the
trunk she was packing. To be going back to Worcester, where <em>he</em> was,
seemed to her like going to paradise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing <em>that</em> for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The emphatic question, spoken in evident surprise, came from her
stepmother. The chamber-door was open; Mrs. Lewis had chanced
to look in as she passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing that for?&rdquo; she stopped to ask. Anne ceased
her song at once and rose from her knees. She really did not know
what it was that had elicited the sharp query&mdash;unless it was the singing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not pack your own things. You are not going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
Worcester. It is intended that you shall remain here and take care of
the house and of Sally.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but, Mrs. Lewis, I could not stay here alone,&rdquo; cried Anne, a
hundred thoughts rushing tumultuously into her mind. &ldquo;It could
not be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not stay here alone! Why, what is to hinder it? Do you suppose
you would get run away with? Now, my dear, we will have no
trouble, if you please. You will stay at home like a good girl&mdash;therefore
you may unpack your box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne went straight to her father, and found him with Herbert
Tanerton. He had walked over from Timberdale to inquire after the
doctor&rsquo;s health.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could this be, papa?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That I am to be left alone here
while you stay at Worcester?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, child,&rdquo; was the peevish answer. &ldquo;My belief
is that you dream dreams, Anne, and then fancy them realities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Mrs. Lewis tells me that I am not to go to Worcester&mdash;that I
am to stay at home,&rdquo; persisted Anne. And she said it before Mrs.
Lewis: who had come into the room then, and was shaking hands with
the parson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, love, it will be so much better for dear Anne to remain
here and see to things,&rdquo; she said, in that sweet company-voice of hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; dissented the doctor, plucking up the courage to be firm. &ldquo;If
Anne stays here, I shall stay. I&rsquo;m sure I should be thankful if you&rsquo;d
let us stay: we should have a bit of peace and quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not make a fuss before the parson. Perhaps she saw that to
hold out might cause some unprofitable commotion. Treating Anne to
a beaming smile, she remarked that her dear papa&rsquo;s wish was of course
law, and bade her run and finish her packing.</p>

<p>And when they arrived the next day at Lake&rsquo;s, and Anne heard that
Henry Angerstyne was in truth still there and knew that she should
soon be in his presence, it did indeed seem to her that she had stepped
into paradise. She was alone when he entered. The others had
sought their respective chambers, leaving Anne to gather up their
packages and follow, and she had her bonnet untied and her arms full
of things when he came into the room. Paradise! she might have
experienced some bliss in her life, but none like unto this. Her veins
were tingling, her heart-blood leaping. How well he looked! how
noble! how superior to other men! As he caught her hand in his, and
bent to whisper his low words of greeting, she could scarcely contain
within bounds the ecstasy of her emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so glad you are back again, Anne! I could not believe the
good news when the letter came to Mrs. Lake this morning. You
have been away two weeks, and they have seemed like months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not come over: you said you should,&rdquo; faltered Anne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay. And I sprained my foot the day you left, and have had to
nurse it. It is not strong yet. Bad luck, was it not? Bristow has
been worse, too. Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must take these things up to papa and Mrs. Lewis. Please let
me go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, before he would release her hand, he suddenly bent his head
and kissed her: once, twice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Anne, I could not help it; it is only a French greeting,&rdquo;
he whispered, as she escaped with her face rosy-red, and her heart
beating time to its own sweet music.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a stay Mr. Angerstyne is making!&rdquo; exclaimed Fanny Podd,
who had run about to seek Miss Dinah, and found her making a new
surplice for Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we are glad to have him,&rdquo; answered Miss Dinah, &ldquo;and he
has had a sprained ankle. We know now what is detaining him in
Worcestershire. It seems that some old lady is lying ill at Malvern,
and he can&rsquo;t get away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some old lady lying ill at Malvern!&rdquo; retorted Fanny, who liked to
take Miss Dinah down when she could. &ldquo;Why should that detain Mr.
Angerstyne? Who is the old lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is a relation of his: his great-aunt, I think. And I believe she
is very fond of him, and won&rsquo;t let him go to any distance. All these
visits he makes to Malvern are to see her. She is very rich, and he
will come in for her money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s rich enough without it; he does not want more
money,&rdquo; grumbled Fanny. &ldquo;If the old lady would leave a little to
those who need it, she might do some good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She would have to be made of gold and diamonds if she left some
to all who need it,&rdquo; sighed Miss Dinah. &ldquo;Mr. Angerstyne deserves to
be rich, he is so liberal with his money. Many a costly dainty he
causes us to send up to that poor sick Captain Bristow, letting him
think it is all in the regular fare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I think it was fearfully sly of him never to tell us why he went
so much to Malvern&mdash;only you must always put in a good word for
everybody, Miss Dinah. I asked him one day what his attraction was,
that he should be perpetually running over there, and he gravely
answered me that he liked the Malvern air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just for a few days, Dr. Lewis seemed to get a little better. Mrs.
Lewis&rsquo;s fascinations had returned to her, and she in a degree kept him
alive. It might have been from goodness of heart, or it might have
been that she did not like to neglect him before people just yet, but
she was ever devising plans for his amusement&mdash;which of course included
that of herself and of her daughters. Mr. Angerstyne had not
been more lavish of money in coach hire than was Mrs. Lewis now.
Carriages for the country and flys for the town&mdash;that was the order of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
the day. Anne was rarely invited to make one of the party: for her
there never seemed room. What of that?&mdash;when by staying at home
she had the society of Mr. Angerstyne.</p>

<p>Whilst they were driving everywhere, or taking their pleasure in the
town, shopping and exhibiting their finery, of which they seemed to
display a new stock perpetually, Anne was left at liberty to enjoy her
dangerous happiness. Dangerous, if it should not come to anything:
and he had not spoken yet. They would sit together over their German,
Anne trying to beat it into him, and laughing with him at his mistakes.
If she went out to walk, she presently found herself overtaken by Mr.
Angerstyne: and they would linger in the mellow light of the soft
autumn days, or in the early twilight. Whatever might come of it,
there could be no question that for the time being she was living in the
most intense happiness. And about a fortnight of this went on without
interruption.</p>

<p>Then Dr. Lewis began to droop. One day when he was out he had
another of those attacks in the carriage. It was very slight, Mrs. Lewis
said when they got back again; he did not lose consciousness for more
than three or four minutes. But he continued to be so weak and ill
afterwards that a physician was called in&mdash;Dr. Malden. What he said
was known only to the patient and his wife, for nobody else was
admitted to the conference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to go home,&rdquo; the doctor said to Anne the next morning,
speaking in his usual querulous, faint tone, and as if his mind were half
gone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I did not smell any paint the last time; it must have
been her fancy. I want to go there to be quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, papa, why don&rsquo;t you say so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s of no use saying so: she won&rsquo;t listen. I can&rsquo;t stand the
racket here, child, and the perpetual driving out: the wheels of the
carriages shake my head. And look at the expense! It frightens
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne scarcely knew what to answer. She herself was powerless;
and, so far as she believed, her father was; utterly so. Powerless in
the hands of his new wife. Dr. Lewis glanced round the room as if to
make sure there were no eavesdroppers, and went on in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terrified, Anne. I am being ruined. All my ready-money&rsquo;s
gone; she has had it all; she made me draw it out of the bank. And
there, in that drawer, are two rolls of bills; she brought them to me
yesterday, and there&rsquo;s nothing to pay them with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne&rsquo;s heart fluttered. Was he only fancying these things in his
decaying mind? Or, were they true?</p>

<p>&ldquo;September has now come in, papa, and your quarter&rsquo;s dividends
will soon be due, you know. Do not worry yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have been forestalled,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;She owed a lot of
things before her marriage, and the people would have sued me had I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
not paid them. I wish we were back in France, child! I wish we
had never left it!&rdquo; And, but for one thing, Anne would have wished
it, too.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>One afternoon, when it was getting late, Anne went into High Street
to buy some ribbon for her hair. Mrs. Lewis and her party had gone
over to Croome, some one having given her an order to see the gardens
there. Lake&rsquo;s house was as busy as it could be, some fresh inmates of
consequence being expected that evening; Anne had been helping Miss
Dinah, and it was only at the last minute she could run out. In coming
back, the ribbon bought, close to the college gates she heard steps
behind her, and found her arm touched. It was by Mr. Angerstyne.
For the past two days&mdash;nearly three&mdash;he had been absent at Malvern.
The sight of him was as if the sun had shone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;is it you?&mdash;are you back again?&rdquo; she cried, with as much
quiet indifference as she could put on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just arrived. My aunt is better. And how are you,
Anne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Need you go in yet? Let us take a short stroll. The afternoon is
delightful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He called it afternoon, but it was getting on fast for evening: and he
turned in at the college gates as he spoke. So they wound round St.
Michael&rsquo;s Churchyard and passed on to the Dark Alley, and so down
the long flight of steps that leads from it, and on to the banks of the
Severn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you all going on at Lake&rsquo;s?&rdquo; he asked presently, breaking
the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as usual. To-day is a grand field-day,&rdquo; Anne added gaily:
&ldquo;at least, this evening is to be one, and we are not to dine until seven
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seven? So much the better. But why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some people of importance are coming&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Angerstyne&rsquo;s laugh interrupted her. She laughed also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are Miss Dinah&rsquo;s words: &lsquo;people of importance.&rsquo; They will
arrive late, so the dinner-hour is put off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care, Anne!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A horse, towing a barge, was overtaking them. Mr. Angerstyne
drew Anne out of the way, and the dinner and the new guests were
forgotten.</p>

<p>It was almost dusk when they returned. The figures on the college
tower were darkened, as they came through the large boat-house gateway:
the old elm-trees, filled with their cawing rooks, looked weird in
the dim twilight. Mr. Angerstyne did not turn to the Dark Alley again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
but went straight up to the Green. He was talking of his estate in
Essex. It was a topic often chosen by him; and Anne seemed to know
the place quite well by this time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would like the little stream that runs through the grounds,&rdquo;
he was observing. &ldquo;It is not, of course, like the grand river we have
just left, but it is pleasant to wander by, for it winds in and out in the
most picturesque manner possible, and the banks are overshadowed by
trees. Yes, Anne, you would like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going through the cloisters?&mdash;is it not too late?&rdquo; she
interrupted, quite at a loss for something to say; not caring to answer
that she <em>should</em> like to wander by the stream.</p>

<p>For he was crossing towards the little south cloister door: though
onwards through the Green would have been their more direct
road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late? No. Why should it be? You are not afraid of ghosts,
are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne laughed. But, lest she should be afraid of ghosts, he put her
hand within his arm as they passed through the dark narrow passage
beyond the postern; and so they marched arm-in-arm through the
cloisters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To sit by that winding stream on a summer&rsquo;s day listening to its
murmurs, to the singing of the birds, the sweet sighing of the trees; or
holding low converse with a cherished companion&mdash;yes, Anne, you
would like that. It would just suit you, for you are of a silent and
dreamy nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There might not be much actual meaning in the words if you sat
down to analyze them: but, to the inexperienced mind of Anne, they
sounded very like plain speaking. At any rate, she took them to be
an earnest that she <em>should</em> sometime sit by that stream with him&mdash;his
wife. The dusky cloisters seemed to have suddenly filled themselves
with refulgent light; the gravestones over which she was passing felt
soft as the mossy glades of fairyland: ay, even that mysterious stone
that bears on it the one terrible word &ldquo;Miserrimus.&rdquo; Heaven was
above her, and heaven beneath: there was no longer any prosaic earth
for Anne Lewis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night to you, gentlefolks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The salutation was from the cloister porter; who, coming into close
the gates, met them as they were nearing the west door. Not another
word had passed until now: Mr. Angerstyne had fallen into silence.
Anne could not have spoken to gain the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night to you, my man,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>Lake&rsquo;s was in a bustle when they reached it. The luggage of the
new people, who had just been shown to their chambers, was being
taken in; the carriage containing Dr. and Mrs. Lewis was then just
driving up. Anne felt alarmed as she caught sight of her father; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
looked so very ill. Mr. Angerstyne, in his ready, kindly way, waited
to help him down and give him his arm along the passage; he then
ran up to his room, remarking that he had letters to write.</p>

<p>The people assembled for dinner in full fig, out of deference to the
new-comers: who proved to be a Lady Knight, and a Mrs. and Miss
Colter. Anne wore her pretty grey bridesmaid&rsquo;s dress, and the ribbon,
just bought, in her hair. At the very last moment, Mr. Angerstyne
came down, his hands full of the letters he had been writing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, are <em>you</em> here?&rdquo; exclaimed Lady Knight: who seemed to be
a chatty, voluble woman. &ldquo;I <em>am</em> surprised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Angerstyne, putting his letters on the side-table, until he could
take them to the post, turned round at the address. A moment&rsquo;s stare,
half doubt, half astonishment, and he went forward to shake Lady
Knight&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been here some little time. Old Miss Gibson is at Malvern,
so I can&rsquo;t go far away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no opportunity for more: dinner was waiting. Mr.
Angerstyne and Anne sat side by side that evening; Lady Knight was
opposite. Miss Dinah presided as usual, her best yellow cap perched
on the top of her curls.</p>

<p>During an interval of silence between the general bustle and rattle
of the dinner, for the two girls who waited (after their own fashion)
had both run away with the fish to bring in the meat, Lady Knight
looked across the table to put a question to Mr. Angerstyne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is your wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The silence dropped to a dead stillness. He appeared not to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is your wife, Henry Angerstyne? Have you seen her lately?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could not pretend to be deaf any longer, and answered with angry
curtness:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I have not. She is all right, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the way the whole table stared, you might have thought a bombshell
had fallen. Miss Dinah sat with her mouth open in sheer amazement,
and then spoke involuntarily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you really married, Mr. Angerstyne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he is married,&rdquo; said Lady Knight, answering Miss Dinah.
&ldquo;All the world knows that. His wife is my cousin. I saw her at
Lowestoft a few weeks ago, Henry. She was looking prettier than
ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mr. Angerstyne, how sly you were, not to tell us!&rdquo; cried
Mrs. Lewis, playfully shaking her fan at him. &ldquo;You&mdash;&mdash; Oh, goodness
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A loud crash! Jenny the maid had dropped a hot vegetable dish
on the floor, scattering the pieces and spilling the peas; and followed
it up with a shriek and a scream. That took off the attention; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
Mr. Angerstyne, coolly eating away at his bread, turned to make some
passing remark to Anne.</p>

<p>But the words he would have said were left unspoken. No ghost
ever seen, in cloisters or out of them, was whiter than she. Lips and
fingers were alike trembling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should be more careful!&rdquo; he called to the maid in a tone of
authority. &ldquo;Ladies don&rsquo;t care to be startled in this way.&rdquo; Just as
though Anne had turned white from the noise of the broken dish!</p>

<p>Well, it had been a dreadful revelation for her. All the sunshine
of this world seemed to have gone out for ever; to have left nothing
behind it but a misty darkness. Rallying her pride and her courage,
she went on with her dinner, as the others did. Her head was throbbing,
her brain on fire; her mind had turned to chaos. She heard them
making arrangements for a picnic-party to the woods at Croome on the
morrow; not in the least understanding what was said or planned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did surprise us!&rdquo; observed Mrs. Lewis to Lady Knight, when
they were in the drawing-room after dinner, and Mr. Angerstyne had
gone out to post his letters. &ldquo;What could have been his motive for
allowing us to think him a bachelor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dislike to mention her name,&rdquo; replied Lady Knight, candidly.
&ldquo;That was it, I expect. He married her for her pretty face, and then
found out what a goose she was. So they did not get on together. She
goes her way, and he goes his; now and then they meet for a week or
two, but it is not often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a very unsatisfactory state of things!&rdquo; cried Miss Dinah,
handing round the cups of coffee herself for fear of another upset. &ldquo;Is
it her fault or his?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faults lie on both sides,&rdquo; said Lady Knight, who had an abrupt
way of speaking, and was as poor as a church mouse. &ldquo;She has a
fearfully affronting temper of her own; those women with dolls&rsquo; faces
sometimes have; and he was not as forbearing as he might have been.
Any way, that is the state of affairs between Mr. and Mrs. Angerstyne:
and, apart from it, there&rsquo;s no scandal or reproach attaching to either of
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne, sitting in a quiet corner, listened to all this mechanically.
What mattered the details to her? the broad fact had been enough.
The hum of conversation was going on all around; her father, looking
somewhat the better for his dinner, was playing at backgammon with
Tom Lake. She saw nothing, knew nothing, until Mr. Angerstyne
dropped into the seat beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall you join this expedition to Croome to-morrow, Anne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Julia and Fanny were thumping over a duet, pedal down, and Anne
barely caught the low-spoken words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; she answered, after a brief pause. &ldquo;My head
aches.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much care about it myself; rather the opposite. I shall
certainly not go if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why! he was speaking to her just as though nothing had occurred!
If anything could have added to her sense of shame and misery it was
this. It sounded like an insult, arousing all the spirit she possessed;
her whole nature rose in rebellion against his line of conduct.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why have you been talking to me these many weeks as you have
been talking, Mr. Angerstyne?&rdquo; she asked in her straightforward simplicity,
turning her face to his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There has been no harm in it,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Harm!</em>&rdquo; she repeated, from her wrung heart. &ldquo;Perhaps not to
you. There has been at least no good in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you only knew what an interval of pleasantness it has been for
me, Anne! Almost deluding me into forgetting my odious chains and
fetters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would a <em>gentleman</em> have so amused himself, Mr. Angerstyne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she gave him no opportunity of reply. Rising from her seat, and
drawing her slight form to its full height, she looked into his face
steadily, knowing not perhaps how much of scorn and reproach her
gaze betrayed, then crossed the room and sat down by her father. Once
after that she caught his eye: caught the expression of sorrow, of
repentance, of deep commiseration that shone in every line of his face&mdash;for
she could not altogether hide the pain seated in her own. And
later, amidst the bustle of the general good-nights, she found her hand
pressed within his, and heard his whispered, contrite prayer&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Anne: forgive me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She lay awake all night, resolving to be brave, to make no sign;
praying Heaven to help her to bear the anguish of her sorely-stricken
heart, not to let the blow quite kill her. It seemed to her that she
must feel it henceforth during all her life.</p>

<p>And before the house was well up in the morning, a messenger
arrived post-haste from Malvern to summon Mr. Angerstyne to his
aunt&rsquo;s dying bed. He told Miss Dinah, when he shook hands with her at
parting, that she might as well send his traps after him, if she would be
so kind, as he thought he might not be able to return to Worcester again.</p>

<p>And that was the ending of Anne Lewis&rsquo;s love. Not a very uncommon
ending, people say. But she had been hardly dealt by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<hr class="l3" />

<h3>Part the Third.</h3>

<p>The blinds of a house closely drawn, the snow drifting against the
windows outside, and somebody lying dead upstairs, cannot be called
a lively state of things. Mrs. Lewis and her daughters, Julia and Fanny
Podd, sitting over the fire in the darkened dining-room at Maythorn
Bank, were finding it just the contrary.</p>

<p>When Dr. Lewis, growing worse and worse during their sojourn at
Lake&rsquo;s boarding-house at Worcester the previous autumn, had one day
plucked up courage to open his mind to his physician, telling him that
he was pining for the quiet of his own little cottage home, and that
the stir and racket at Lake&rsquo;s was more than he could bear, Dr.
Malden peremptorily told Mrs. Lewis that he must have his wish,
<em>and go</em>. So she had to give in, and prepared to take him; though it
went frightfully against the grain. That was in September, three
months back; he had been getting weaker and more imbecile ever
since, and now, just as Christmas was turned, he had sunk quietly
away to his rest.</p>

<p>Anne, his loving, gentle daughter, had been his constant companion
and attendant. He had not been so ill as to lie in bed, but a great
deal had to be done for him, especially in the matter of amusing what
poor remnant of mind was left. She read to him, she talked to him,
she wrapped great-coats about him, and took him out to walk on sunshiny
days in the open walk by the laurels. It was well for Anne that
she was thus incessantly occupied, for it diverted her mind from the
misery left there by the unwarrantable conduct of Mr. Angerstyne.
When a girl&rsquo;s lover proves faithless, to dwell upon him and lament him
brings to her a sort of painful pleasure: but that negative indulgence
was denied to Anne Lewis: Henry Angerstyne was the husband of
another, and she might not, willingly, keep him in her thoughts. To
forget him, as she strove to do, was a hard and bitter task: but the
indignation she felt at the man&rsquo;s deceit and cruel conduct was materially
helping her. Once, since, she had seen his name in the <cite>Times</cite>: it was
amongst the list of visitors staying at some nobleman&rsquo;s country-house.
Henry Angerstyne. And the thrill that passed through her veins as
the name caught her eye, the sudden stopping and then rushing
violently onwards of her life&rsquo;s blood, convinced her how little she had
forgotten him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I shall forget him in time,&rdquo; she said to herself, pressing her
hand upon her wildly-beating heart. &ldquo;In time, God helping me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And from that moment she redoubled her care and thought for her
father; and he died blessing her and her love for him.</p>

<p>Anne felt the loss keenly; though perhaps not quite so much so as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
she would have felt it had her later life been less full of suffering. It
seemed to be but the last drop added to her cup of bitterness. She
knew that to himself death was a release: he had ceased to find
pleasure in life. And now she was left amidst strangers, or worse
than strangers; she seemed not to have a friend to turn to in the wide
world.</p>

<p>Dr. Lewis had died on Monday morning. This was Tuesday. Mrs.
Lewis had been seeing people to-day and yesterday, giving her orders;
but never once consulting Anne, or paying her the compliment to say,
Would you like it to be this way, or that?</p>

<p>&ldquo;How on earth any human being could have pitched upon this
wretched out-of-the-world place, Crabb, to settle down in, puzzles me
completely,&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Mrs. Lewis, bending forward to stir
the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must have been a lunatic,&rdquo; acquiesced Julia, irreverently alluding
to the poor man who was lying in the room above.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a decent shop in the place! Not a dressmaker who can
cut out a properly-fitting skirt! Be quiet, Fanny: you need not
<em>dance</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One does not know what to do,&rdquo; grumbled Fanny, ceasing to shuffle,
and returning to her seat. &ldquo;But I should like to know, mamma, about
our mourning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I shall go to Worcester to-day and order it,&rdquo; spoke up Mrs.
Lewis, briskly, after a pause. &ldquo;Necessity has no law; and we cannot
get proper things unless I do. Yes, we will go: I don&rsquo;t mind the
weather. Julia, ring the bell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne&mdash;poor Anne&mdash;came in to answer the bell. She had no choice:
Sally was out on an errand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just see that we have a tray in with the cold meat, Anne, at half-past
twelve. We must go to Worcester about the mourning&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Worcester!&rdquo; involuntarily interrupted Anne, in her surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no help for it, though of course it&rsquo;s not the thing I would
choose to do,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lewis, coldly. &ldquo;One cannot provide proper
things here: bonnets especially. I will get you a bonnet at the same
time. And we must have a bit of something, hot and nice, for tea,
when we come home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; sighed Anne.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Anne sat in the same room alone, busy over some
black work, on which her tears dropped slowly. When it was growing
dusk, Mr. Coney and the young Rector of Timberdale came in together.
Herbert Tanerton did not forget that his late stepfather and Dr. Lewis
were half-brothers. Anne brushed away the signs of her tears, laid
down her work, and stirred the fire into a blaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my lass,&rdquo; said the farmer, in his plain, homely way, but he
always meant kindly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just heard that that stepmother of yours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
went off to Worcester to-day with those two dandified girls of hers, and
so I thought I&rsquo;d drop in while the coast was clear. I confess I don&rsquo;t
like her: and I say that somebody ought to look a bit to you and your
interests.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I, coming over upon much the same errand, met Mr. Coney
at the gate,&rdquo; added Herbert Tanerton, with a smile as near geniality as
he ever gave. &ldquo;I wish to express my deep regret for your loss, Miss
Lewis, and to assure you of my true sympathy. You will think my
visit a late one, but I had a&mdash;a service this afternoon.&rdquo; He would not
say a funeral.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are both very, very kind,&rdquo; said Anne, her eyes again filling,
&ldquo;and I thank you for thinking of me. I feel isolated from all: this
place at best is strange to me after my life&rsquo;s home in France. It seems
that I have not a friend in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have,&rdquo; said the farmer; &ldquo;and if my wife had not been
staying with our sick daughter at Worcester, she&rsquo;d have been in to tell
you the same. My dear, you are just going, please, to make a friend
of <em>me</em>. And you won&rsquo;t think two or three questions, that I should like
to put, impertinent, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I certainly will not,&rdquo; said Anne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, to begin with: Did your father make a will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes. I hold it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you chance to know how the property is left?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To me. No name but my own is mentioned in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Coney. &ldquo;I feared he might
have been leaving somebody else some. You will have about two
hundred and fifty pounds a-year; and that&rsquo;s enough for a young girl.
When your father first came over, he spoke to me of his income and
his means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I fear the income will be somewhat diminished from what it
was,&rdquo; hesitated Anne, turning red at having to confess so much,
because it would tell against her stepmother. &ldquo;My father has had to
sell out a good deal lately, to entrench upon his capital. I think the
trouble it gave him hastened his end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sell out for what?&rdquo; asked old Coney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For bills, and&mdash;and debts, that came upon him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her bills? Her debts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne did not expressly answer, but old Coney caught up the truth,
and nodded his head in wrath. He as good as knew it before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, child, I suppose you may reckon, at the worst, on a clear
two hundred a-year, and you can live on that. Not keep house,
perhaps; and it would be very lonely for you also. You will have to
take up your abode with some pleasant family: many a one would be
glad to have you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to go back to France,&rdquo; sighed Anne, recalling the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
misery that England had brought her: first in her new stepmother,
then in Mr. Angerstyne, and now in her father&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;I have many
dear friends in France who will take every care of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; cried old Coney, with a blank look. &ldquo;France
may be very well for some people; but I&rsquo;d almost as lieve go to the
gallows as there. Don&rsquo;t you like England?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like it well, if I&mdash;if I could be happy in it,&rdquo; she answered,
turning red again at the thought of him who had marred her happiness.
&ldquo;But, you see, I have no ties here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must make ties, my lass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much of the income ought I to pay over yearly to Mrs. Lewis,
do you think?&rdquo; she questioned. &ldquo;Half of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Half!</em> No!&rdquo; burst forth old Coney, coughing down a strong word
which had nearly slipped out. &ldquo;You will give her none. <em>None.</em> A
pretty idea of justice you must have, Anne Lewis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it would be fair to give it her,&rdquo; argued Anne. &ldquo;My father
married her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, did he, though! She married him. <em>I</em> know. Other folks
know. You will give her none, my dear, and allow her none. She is
a hard, scheming, deceitful brickbat of a woman. What made her lay
hold of your poor weakened father, and play off upon him her wiles
and her guiles, and marry him, right or wrong?&rdquo; ran on old Coney,
getting purple enough for apoplexy. &ldquo;She did it for a home; she did
it that she might get her back debts paid; that&rsquo;s what. She has had
her swing as long as his poor life lasted, and put you down as if you
were a changeling; we have all seen <em>that</em>. Now that her short day&rsquo;s
over, she must go back again to her own ways and means. Ask the
parson there what he thinks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The parson, in his cold sententious way, that was so much more
suited to an old bishop than a young rector, avowed that he thought
with Mr. Coney. He could not see that Mrs. Lewis&rsquo;s few months of
marriage entitled her (all attendant circumstances being taken into
consideration) to deprive Miss Lewis of any portion of her patrimony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure you have got the will all tight and safe?&rdquo; resumed
Mr. Coney. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t answer for her not stealing it. Ah, you may
laugh, young lassie, but I don&rsquo;t like that woman. Miss Dinah Lake
was talking to me a bit the other day; she don&rsquo;t like her, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne was smiling at his vehement partisanship. She rose, unlocked
a desk that stood on the side-table, and brought out a parchment,
folded and sealed. It was subscribed, &ldquo;Will of Thomas Lewis, M.D.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Papa had it drawn up by an English
lawyer just before we left France. He gave it to me, as he was apt to
mislay things himself, charging me to keep it safely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And mind you do keep it safely,&rdquo; enjoined old Coney. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
be opened, I suppose, till after the funeral&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But wait a minute,&rdquo; interposed the clergyman. &ldquo;Does not
marriage&mdash;a subsequent marriage&mdash;render a will invalid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless my heart, no: much justice there&rsquo;d be in that!&rdquo; retorted old
Coney, who knew about as much of law as he did of the moon. And
Mr. Tanerton said no more; he was not certain; and supposed the
older and more experienced man might be right.</p>

<p>Anne sighed as she locked up the will again. She was both just
and generous; and she knew she should be sure to hand over to Mrs.
Lewis the half of whatever income it might give her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my girl,&rdquo; said the farmer, as they prepared to leave, &ldquo;if you
want me, or anything I can do, you just send Sally over, and I&rsquo;ll be
here in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is to be at Timberdale, I conclude?&rdquo; whispered Herbert
Tanerton, as he shook hands. Anne knew that he alluded to the
funeral; and the colour came up in her face as she answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. My father wished it; he said he wished to lie
beside his brother. But Mrs. Lewis&mdash;here they come, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They came in with snowy bonnets and red noses, stamping the slush
off their shoes. It was a good walk from the station. Mrs. Lewis had
expected to get a fly there; one was generally in waiting: but some
one jumped out of the train before she did, and secured it. It made
her feel cross and look cross.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a wretched trapes!&rdquo; she was beginning in a vinegar tone;
but at sight of the gentlemen her face and voice smoothed down to oil.
She begged them to resume their seats; but they said they were
already going.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were just asking about the funeral,&rdquo; the farmer stayed to say.
&ldquo;It is to be at Timberdale?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Up went Mrs. Lewis&rsquo;s handkerchief to her eyes. &ldquo;Dear Mr. Coney,
I think not. Crabb will be better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he wished to lie at Timberdale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crabb will be so much cheaper&mdash;and less trouble,&rdquo; returned the
widow, with a sob. &ldquo;It is as well to avoid useless expense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cheaper!&rdquo; cried old Coney, his face purple again with passion, so
much did he dislike her and her ways. &ldquo;Not cheaper at all. <em>Dearer.</em>
Dearer, ma&rsquo;am. Must have a hearse and coach any way: and Herbert
Tanerton here won&rsquo;t charge fees if it&rsquo;s done at Timberdale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, just as you please, my dear sir. And if <em>he</em> wished it, poor
dear! Yes, yes; Timberdale of course. Anywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They got out before she had dried her eyes&mdash;or pretended at it.
Julia and Fanny then fetched in some bandboxes which had been waiting
in the passage. Mrs. Lewis forgot her tears, and put back her cloak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which is Anne&rsquo;s?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Oh, this one&rdquo;&mdash;beginning to
undo one of the boxes. &ldquo;My own will be sent to-morrow night. I
bought yours quite plain, Anne.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>Very plain indeed was the bonnet she handed out. Plain and
common, and made of the cheapest materials; one that a lady would
not like to put upon her head. Julia and Fanny were trying theirs on
at the chimney-glass. Gay bonnets, theirs glistening with jet beads
and black flowers. The bill lay open on the table, and Anne read the
cost: her own, twelve shillings; the other two, thirty-three shillings
each. Mrs. Lewis made a grab at the bill, and crushed it into her
pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew you would prefer it plain,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;For real mourning
it is always a mistake to have things too costly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; acquiesced Anne; &ldquo;but yet&mdash;I think they should be <em>good</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed to her that to wear this bonnet would be very like disrespect
to the dead. She silently determined to buy a better as soon
as she had the opportunity of doing so.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of all days, for weather, the one of the funeral was about the worst.
Sleet, snow, rain, and wind. The Squire had a touch of lumbago; he
could not face it; and old Coney came bustling in to say that I was to
attend in his place. Anne wanted Johnny Ludlow to go all along, he
added; her father had liked him; only there was no room before in
the coach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; cried the Squire, &ldquo;Johnny, of course. He is not afraid
of lumbago. Make haste and get into your black things, lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, it was shivery, as we rolled along in the creaky old mourning-coach,
behind the hearse: Mr. Coney and the Podds&rsquo; lawyer-cousin
from Birmingham on one side; I and Cole, the doctor, opposite. The
sleet pattered against the windows, the wind whistled in our ears.
The lawyer kept saying &ldquo;eugh,&rdquo; and shaking his shoulders, telling us
he had a cold in his head; and looked just as stern as he had at the
wedding.</p>

<p>All was soon over: Herbert Tanerton did not read slowly to-day:
and we got back to Maythorn Bank. Cole had left us: he stopped
the coach en route, and cut across a field to see a patient: but Mr.
Coney drew me into the house with him after the lawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will go in, Johnny,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;The poor girl has no
relation or friend to back her up, and I shall stay with her while the
will&rsquo;s read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewis, in a new widow&rsquo;s cap as big as a house, and the two
girls in shining jet chains, were sitting in state. Anne came in the
next minute, her face pale, her eyes red. We all sat down; and for a
short time looked at one another in silence, like so many mutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any will to be read? I am told there is one,&rdquo; spoke the lawyer&mdash;who
had, as Fanny Podd whispered to me, a wife at home as sour as
himself. &ldquo;If so, it had better be produced: I have to catch a train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is a will,&rdquo; answered old Coney, glad to find that Anne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
as he assumed, had mentioned the fact. &ldquo;Miss Lewis holds the will.
Will you get it, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne unlocked the desk on the side-table, and put the will into Mr.
Coney&rsquo;s hand. Without saying with your leave or by your leave, he
broke the seals, and clapped on his spectacles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s <em>that</em>?&rdquo; Mrs. Lewis asked old Coney, from her seat on the
sofa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Lewis&rsquo;s will, ma&rsquo;am. Made in France, I believe: was it not,
Miss Anne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, sweet creature, it is so much waste paper,&rdquo; spoke Mrs.
Lewis, smiling sweetly upon Anne. &ldquo;My deeply lamented husband&rsquo;s
last will and testament was made long since he left France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pulling up the sofa-cushion at her elbow, she produced another will,
and asked the lawyer if he would be good enough to unseal and read
it. It had been made, as the date proved, at Cheltenham, the day
after she and Dr. Lewis were married; and it left every earthly thing
he possessed to &ldquo;his dear wife, Louisa Jane Lewis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Old Coney&rsquo;s face was a picture. He stared alternately at the will in
his hands, at the one just read by the lawyer. Anne stood meekly by
his side; looking as if she did not understand matters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>That</em> can&rsquo;t stand good!&rdquo; spoke the farmer, in his honest indignation.
&ldquo;The money can&rsquo;t go to you, ma&rsquo;am&rdquo;&mdash;turning his burly
form about to face Mrs. Lewis, and treading on my toes as he did it.
&ldquo;The money is this young lady&rsquo;s; part of it comes from her own
mother: it can&rsquo;t be yours. Thomas Lewis must have signed the will
in his sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does a daughter inherit before a wife, dear sir?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Lewis,
in a voice soft as butter. &ldquo;It is the most just will my revered husband
could have made. I <em>need</em> the money: I cannot keep on the house
without it. Anne does not need it: she has no house to keep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; says old Coney, buttoning his coat and looking fiercely
at the company. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my wish to be rude to-day, remembering
what place we came straight here from; but if you don&rsquo;t want to be
put down as&mdash;as schemers, you will not lose an hour in making over
the half of that income to Anne Lewis. It is what she proposed to do
by <em>you</em>, madam, when she thought all was left to her,&rdquo; he added,
brushing past Mrs. Lewis. &ldquo;Come along, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>The time went on. Mrs. Lewis kept all the money. She gave
notice to leave the house at Midsummer: but she had it on her hands
until then, and told people she should die of its dulness. So far as
could be known, she had little, if any, income, except that which she
inherited from Dr. Lewis.</p>

<p>Anne&rsquo;s days did not pass in clover. Treated as of no moment, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
was made fully to understand that she was only tolerated in what was
once her own home; and she had to make herself useful in it from
morning till night, just like a servant. Remembering what had been,
and what was, Anne felt heart-broken, submitting patiently and unresistingly
to every trial; but a reaction set in, and her spirit grew
rebellious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any remedy, I wonder?&rdquo; she asked herself one night in
her little chamber, when preparing for bed, and the day had been a
particularly trying day. She had ventured to ask for a few shillings
for some purpose or other, and was told she could not have them:
being Easter-Monday, Sally had had a holiday, and she had been kept
at work like a slave in the girl&rsquo;s place: Herbert Tanerton and his wife
had come to invite her for a day or two to Timberdale, and a denial
was returned to them without herself being consulted, or even allowed
to see them. Yes, it had been a trying day. And in France Easter
had always been kept as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there not a remedy?&rdquo; she debated, as she slowly undressed.
&ldquo;I have no home but this; but&mdash;could I not find one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She knew that she had no means of living, except by her own
exertions; she had not even a rag to wear or a coin to spend, except
what should come to her by Mrs. Lewis&rsquo;s bounty. And, whether that
lady possessed bounty or not, she seemed never to possess ready-money.
It appeared to Anne that she had been hardly dealt by in
more ways than one; that the world was full of nothing but injustice
and trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I fancy,&rdquo; added Anne, thinking out her thoughts, &ldquo;that they
will be glad to get rid of me; that they want me gone. So I dare say
there will be no objection made here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With morning light, she was up and busy. It fell to her lot to prepare
the breakfast: and she must not keep the ladies waiting for it one
minute. This morning, however, she had to keep them waiting; but
not through any fault of hers.</p>

<p>They grew impatient. Five minutes past nine: ten minutes past
nine: what did Anne mean? Julia and Fanny were not much better
dressed than when they got out of bed; old jackets on, rough and
rumpled hair stuck up with hair-pins. In that respect they presented
a marked contrast to Anne, who was ever trim and nice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she must be growing the coffee-berries!&rdquo; cried Fanny, as
she flung the door open. &ldquo;<em>Is</em> that breakfast coming to-day, or to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In two minutes,&rdquo; called back Anne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a dreary life it is out here!&rdquo; groaned Mrs. Lewis.
&ldquo;Girls, I think we will go over to Worcester to-day, and arrange to stay
a week at Lakes. And then you can go to the subscription ball at the
Town Hall, that you are so wild over.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do, do!&rdquo; cried Julia, all animation now. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t go to
that ball, I shall die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall run away, if we don&rsquo;t; I have said all along I would not
miss the Easter ball,&rdquo; spoke Fanny. &ldquo;Mamma, I cannot <em>think</em> why
you don&rsquo;t shut this miserable house up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you find the rent for another?&rdquo; coolly asked Mrs Lewis.
&ldquo;What <em>can</em> that girl be at with the coffee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It came in at last; and Anne was abused for her laziness. When
she could get a word in, she explained that Sally had had an accident
with the tea-kettle, and fresh water had to be boiled.</p>

<p>More indignation: Julia&rsquo;s egg turned out to be bad. What business
had Anne to boil bad eggs? Anne, saying nothing, took it away,
boiled another and brought it in. Then Mrs. Lewis fancied she could
eat a thin bit of toasted bacon; and Anne must go and do it at the end
of a fork. Altogether the breakfast was nearly at an end before she
could sit down and eat her own bread-and-butter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking,&rdquo; she began, in a hesitating tone, to Mrs.
Lewis, &ldquo;that I should like to go out. If you have no objection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go out where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Into some situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewis, in the act of conveying a piece of bacon to her mouth,
held it suspended in mid-air, and stared at Anne in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Into <em>what</em>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A situation in some gentleman&rsquo;s family. I have no prospect before
me; no home; I must earn my own living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s daft!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Lewis, resuming her breakfast. &ldquo;No
home! Why, you have a home here; your proper home. Was it not
your father&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But it is not mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is yours; and your days in it are spent usefully. What more can
you want? Now, Anne, hold your tongue, and don&rsquo;t talk nonsense.
If you have finished your breakfast you can begin to take the things
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamma, why don&rsquo;t you let her go?&rdquo; whispered Fanny, as Anne
went out with some plates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because she is useful to me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Lewis. &ldquo;Who else is there
to see to our comforts? We should be badly off with that incapable
Sally. And who would do all the needlework? recollect how much
she gets through. No, as long as we are here, Anne must stay with
us. Besides, the neighbourhood would have its say finely if we let her
turn out. People talk, as it is, about the will, and are not so friendly
as they might be. As if they would like me to fly in the face of my
dear departed husband&rsquo;s wishes, and tacitly reproach his judgment!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Anne did not give up. When she had taken all the things away
and folded up the table-cloth, she came in again and spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you will not oppose me in this, Mrs. Lewis. I should like
to take a situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, pray, what situation do you suppose you could take?&rdquo;
ironically asked Mrs. Lewis. &ldquo;You are not fitted to fill one in a gentleman&rsquo;s
family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless it be as cook,&rdquo; put in Julia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or seamstress,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;By the way, I want some more
cuffs made, Anne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to try for a situation, notwithstanding my deficiencies.
I could do something or other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s enough: must I tell you again not to talk nonsense?&rdquo;
retorted Mrs. Lewis. &ldquo;And now you must come upstairs and see to
my things, and to Julia&rsquo;s and Fanny&rsquo;s. We are going to Worcester by
the half-past eleven train&mdash;and you may expect us home to tea when
you see us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went off. As soon as their backs were turned, Anne came
running into our house, finding me and Mrs. Todhetley at the piano.
It was pleasant Easter weather, though March was not out: the Squire
and Tod had gone to Dyke Manor on some business, and would not be
home till late. Anne told all her doubts and difficulties to the mater,
and asked her advice, as to whether there would be anything wrong in
her seeking for a situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my dear,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;it would be right, instead of wrong.
If&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If people treated me as they treat you, Anne, I wouldn&rsquo;t stay with
them a day,&rdquo; said I, hotly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like toads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Johnny!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Todhetley. &ldquo;Never call names, dear.
No obligation whatever, Anne, lies on you to remain in that home; and
I think you would do well to leave it. You shall stay and dine with
me and Johnny at one o&rsquo;clock, Anne; and we will talk it over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could stay,&rdquo; said poor Anne; &ldquo;I hardly knew how to
spare these few minutes to run here. Mrs. Lewis has left me a gown
to unpick and turn, and I must hasten to begin it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So would I begin it!&rdquo; I cried, going out with her as far as the gate.
&ldquo;And I should like to know who is a toad, if she&rsquo;s not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I might be a nursery governess, Johnny?&rdquo; she
asked me, turning round after going through the gate. &ldquo;I might teach
French, and English, and German: and I am very fond of little children.
The difficulty will be to get an introduction. I have thought of one
person who might give it me&mdash;if I could only dare to ask him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Robert Tenby. He is of the great world, and must know every
one in it. And he has always shown himself so very sociable and kind.
Do you think I might venture to apply to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? He could not eat you for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>She ran on, and I ran back. But, all that day, sitting over her work,
Anne was in a state of doubt, not able to make up her mind. It was
impossible to know how Sir Robert Tenby might take it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have made you a drop of coffee and a bit of hot toast and butter,
Miss Anne,&rdquo; said Sally, coming in with a small tray. &ldquo;Buttered it well.
She&rsquo;s not here to see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne laughed, and thanked her; Mrs. Lewis had left them only cold
bacon for dinner, and ordered them to wait tea until her return. But
before the refreshment was well disposed of, she and the girls came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How soon you are back!&rdquo; involuntarily cried Anne, hoping Mrs.
Lewis would not smell the coffee. &ldquo;And how are they all at Lake&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewis answered by giving a snappish word to Lake&rsquo;s, and
ordered Anne to get tea ready. Fanny whispered the information that
they were going to Worcester on the morrow to stay over the Easter
ball; but <em>not to Lake&rsquo;s</em>. Anne wondered at that.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at Lake&rsquo;s that morning, Miss Dinah had received them
very coolly; and was, as Mrs. Lewis remarked afterwards, barely civil.
The fact was, Miss Dinah, being just-minded, took up Anne&rsquo;s cause
rather warmly; and did not scruple to think that the beguiling poor
weak-minded Dr. Lewis out of the will he made, was just a piece of
iniquity, and nothing less. Perceiving Miss Dinah&rsquo;s crusty manner,
Mrs. Lewis inquired after Mrs. Lake. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Emma?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much occupied to-day. Can I do anything for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are thinking of coming to you to-morrow for a week, Dinah;
I and my two girls. They are wild to go to the Easter ball. Which
rooms can you give us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not any rooms,&rdquo; spoke Miss Dinah, decisively. &ldquo;We cannot take
you in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not take me in! When the servant opened the door to us she
said the house was not full. I put the question to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we are expecting it to be full,&rdquo; said Miss Dinah, curtly. &ldquo;The
Beales generally come over to the ball; and we must keep rooms for
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that they are coming, I expect. And in a boarding-house
the rule holds good, &lsquo;First come, first served.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A boarding-house holds its own rules, and is not guided by other
people&rsquo;s. Very sorry: but we cannot make room this time for you
and your daughters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon see that,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Lewis, getting hot. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
Emma Lake? I am her cousin, and shall insist on being taken in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t take you in without my consent. And she won&rsquo;t: that&rsquo;s
more. Look here, Mrs. Podd&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;the new name does
not always come pat to me. When you were staying here before, and
kept us so long out of our money, it put us to more inconvenience than
you had any idea of. We&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You were paid at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Dinah; &ldquo;with poor Dr. Lewis&rsquo;s money, I expect.
We made our minds up then, Mrs. Lewis, not to take you again. At
least, <em>I</em> did; and Mrs. Lake agreed with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not have to wait again: I have money in my pocket now.
And the girls must go to the ball on Thursday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your pockets are all full of money, it can make no difference to
me. I&rsquo;m sorry to say I cannot take you in, Mrs. Lewis: and now I
have said all I mean to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewis went about the house, looking for Mrs. Lake, and did not
find her. She, not as strong-minded as Miss Dinah, had bolted herself
into the best bedroom, just then unoccupied. So Mrs. Lewis, not to be
baffled as to the ball, went out to look for other lodgings, and found
them in Foregate Street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we shall be home on Saturday,&rdquo; she said to Anne, as they
were starting this second time for Worcester, on the Wednesday morning,
the finery for the ball behind them in two huge trunks. &ldquo;I have
to pay a great deal for the rooms, and can&rsquo;t afford to stay longer than
that. And mind that you and Sally get the house in order whilst we
are away; it&rsquo;s a beautiful opportunity to clean it thoroughly down:
and get on as quickly as you can with the needlework.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear young lassie, I am not able to help you in such a
thing as this. You had better see the master himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne had lost no time. Leaving Sally to the cleaning, she dressed
and walked over on the Wednesday afternoon to Bellwood, Sir Robert
Tenby&rsquo;s seat. She explained her business to Mrs. Macbean, the old
family housekeeper, and asked whether she could help her into any
good family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nae, nae, child. I live down here all my days, and I know nothing
of the gentlefolks in the great world. The master knows them all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did think once of asking if I might see Sir Robert; but my courage
fails me now,&rdquo; said Anne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why should it?&rdquo; returned the old lady. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s one man
more ready than another to do a kindness, or more sociable to speak
with, it&rsquo;s Sir Robert Tenby. He takes after his mother for that, my
late dear lady; not after his father. Sir George was a bit proud. I&rsquo;ll
go and tell Sir Robert what you want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Robert was in his favourite room; a small one, with a bright fire
in it, its purple chairs and curtains bordered with gold. It was bright
altogether, Anne thought as she entered: for he said he would see her.
The windows looked out on a green velvet lawn, with beds of early
flowers, and thence to the park; and, beyond all, to the chain of the
Malvern Hills, rising against the blue sky. The baronet sat near one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
of the windows, some books on a small table at his elbow. He came
forward to shake hands with Anne, and gave her a chair opposite his
own. And, what with his good homely face and its smile of welcome,
and his sociable, unpretending words, Anne felt at home at once.</p>

<p>In her own quiet way, so essentially that of a lady in its unaffected
truth, she told him what she wanted: to find a home in some good
family, who would be kind to her in return for her services, and pay
her as much as would serve to buy her gowns and bonnets. Sir Robert
Tenby, no stranger to the gossip rife in the neighbourhood, had heard
of the unjust will, and of Anne&rsquo;s treatment by the new wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, I imagine, impossible for a young lady to get into a good
family without an introduction,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;And I thought&mdash;perhaps&mdash;you
might speak for me, sir: you do know a little of me. I
have no one else to recommend me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not answer for the moment: he sat looking at her. Anne
blushed, and went on, hoping she was not offending him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one else, I mean, who possesses your influence, and mixes
habitually with the great world. I should not care to take service in
an inferior family: my poor father would not have liked it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take service,&rdquo; said he, repeating the word. &ldquo;It is as governess
that you wish to go out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As nursery governess, I thought. I may not aspire to any better
position, for I know nothing of accomplishments. But little children
need to be taught French and German; I could do that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak French well, of course?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a native. German also. And I think I speak good English,
and could teach it. And oh, sir, if you did chance to know of any
family who would engage me, I should be so grateful to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;French, English, and German,&rdquo; said he, smiling. &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t
tell what the great world, as you put it, may call accomplishments;
but I think those three enough for anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne smiled too. &ldquo;They are only languages, Sir Robert. They
are not music and drawing. Had my dear mamma suspected I should
have to earn my own living, she would have had me educated for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it is a very hard thing that you should have to earn it,&rdquo;
spoke Sir Robert.</p>

<p>Anne glanced up through her wet eye-lashes: reminiscences of her
mother always brought tears. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no help for it, sir; I have not
a shilling in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And no home but one that you are ill-treated in&mdash;made to do the
work of a servant? Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne coloured painfully. How did he know this? Generous to
Mrs. Lewis in spite of all, she did not care to speak of it herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if people did not think me clever enough to teach, sir,&rdquo; she
went on, passing over his question, &ldquo;I might perhaps go out to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
useful in other ways. I can make French cakes and show a cook how
to make French dishes; and I can read aloud well, and do all kinds of
needlework. Some old lady, who has no children of her own, might be
glad to have me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think many an old lady would,&rdquo; said he. The remark put her
in spirits. She grew animated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you! I am so glad. If you should know of one, sir, would
you please to tell her of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Robert nodded, and Anne rose to leave. He rose also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could be so fortunate as to get into such a home as this, with
some kind old lady for my friend and mistress, I should be quite happy,&rdquo;
she said, in the simplicity of her heart. &ldquo;How pleasant this room is!
and how beautiful it is outside!&rdquo;&mdash;pausing to look at the early flowers,
as she passed the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know Bellwood? Were you ever here before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, never.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir Robert put on his hat and went out with her, showing her some
pretty spots about the grounds. Anne was enchanted, especially with
the rocks and the cascades. Versailles, she thought, could not be
better than Bellwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when you hear of anything, sir, you will please to let me
know?&rdquo; she said, in parting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. You had better come again soon. This is Wednesday:
suppose you call on Friday. Will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I shall be only too glad. I will be sure to come. Good-bye,
Sir Robert: and thank you very, very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went home with a light heart: she had not felt so happy since
her father died.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How good he is! how kind! a true gentleman,&rdquo; she thought.
&ldquo;And what a good thing he fixed Friday instead of Saturday, for on
Saturday they will be at home. But it is hardly possible that he will
have heard of any place by that time, unless he has one in his eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Friday afternoon before Anne could get to Bellwood, and
rather late, also. She asked, as before, for Mrs. Macbean, not liking
to ask direct for Sir Robert Tenby. Sir Robert was out, but was
expected in every minute, and Anne waited in Mrs. Macbean&rsquo;s
parlour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think he has heard of anything for me?&rdquo; was one of the
first questions she put.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, my dear, and how should I know?&rdquo; was the old lady&rsquo;s reply.
&ldquo;He does not tell me of his affairs. Not but what he talks to me a
good deal, and always like a friend: he does not forget that my late
leddy, his mother, made more of a friend of me than a servant. Many&rsquo;s
the half-hour he keeps me talking in his parlour; and always bids me
take the easiest seat there. I wish he would marry!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; replied Anne, mechanically: for she was thinking more
of her own concerns than Sir Robert&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, that I do. It&rsquo;s a lonely life for him at best, the one he
leads. I&rsquo;ve not scrupled to tell him, times and oft, that he ought to
bring a mistress home&mdash;&mdash; Eh, but there he is! That&rsquo;s his step.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As before, Anne went into the pretty room that Sir Robert, when
alone, mostly sat in. Three or four opened letters lay upon the table,
and she wondered whether they related to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I have as yet no news for you,&rdquo; he said, smiling at her eager
face, and keeping her hand in his while he spoke. &ldquo;You will have to
come again for it. Sit down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if&mdash;if you have nothing to tell me to-day, I had better not take
up your time,&rdquo; said Anne, not liking to appear intrusive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My time! If you knew how slowly time some days seems to pass
for me, you would have no scruple about &lsquo;taking it up.&rsquo; Sit here.
This is a pleasant seat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With her eyes fixed on the outer landscape, Anne sat on and listened
to him. He talked of various things, and she felt as much at her ease
(as she told me that same evening) as though she had been talking
with me. Afterwards she felt half afraid she had been too open, for
she told him all about her childhood&rsquo;s home in France and her dear
mother. It was growing dusk when she got up to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you come again on Monday afternoon?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I shall
be out in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can, sir. Oh yes, if I can. But Mrs. Lewis, who will be at
home then, does not want me to take a situation at all, and she may
not let me come out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should come without telling her,&rdquo; smiled Sir Robert. &ldquo;Not
want you to leave home, eh? Would you like to stay there to make
the puddings? Ay, I understand. Well, I shall expect you on Monday.
There may be some news, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, somehow, Anne took up the notion that there would be news,
his tone sounded so hopeful. All the way home her feet seemed to
tread on air.</p>

<p>On the Sunday evening, when they were all sitting together at Maythorn
Bank, and Anne had no particular duty on hand, she took courage
to tell of what she had done, and that Sir Robert Tenby was so good
as to interest himself for her. Mrs. Lewis was indignant; the young
ladies were pleasantly satirical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As nursery governess: you!&rdquo; mocked Miss Julia. &ldquo;What shall
you teach your pupils? To play at cats&rsquo; cradle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you know, Anne, you are not <em>fit</em> for a governess,&rdquo; said
Fanny. &ldquo;It would be quite&mdash;quite <em>wicked</em> of you to make believe to
be one. You never learnt a note of music. You can&rsquo;t draw. You
can&rsquo;t paint.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better go to school yourself, first,&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Lewis.
&ldquo;I will not allow you to take such a step: so put all thought of it out
of your head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anne leaned her aching brow upon her hand in perplexity. Was
she so unfit? Would it be wicked? She determined to put the case
fully before her kind friend, Sir Robert Tenby, and ask his opinion.</p>

<p>Providing that she could get to Sir Robert&rsquo;s. Ask leave to go, she
dare not; for she knew the answer would be a point-blank refusal.</p>

<p>But fortune favoured her. Between three and four o&rsquo;clock on
Monday afternoon, Mrs. Lewis and her daughters dressed themselves
and sailed away to call on some people at South Crabb; which lay in
just the contrary direction to Bellwood. They left Anne a heap of
sewing to do: but she left the sewing and went out on her own score.
I met her near the Ravine. She told me what she had done, and
looked bright and flushed over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Lewis is one cat, and they are two other cats, Anne. Tod
says so. Good-bye. Good luck to you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, my dear, and I was beginning to think you didna mean to
come,&rdquo; was Mrs. Macbean&rsquo;s salutation. &ldquo;But Sir Robert is nae back
yet, he has been out on horseback since the morning; and he said you
were to wait for him. So just take your bonnet off, and you shall have
a cup of tea with me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing loth, Anne took off her outdoor things. &ldquo;They will be
home before I am, and find me gone out,&rdquo; she reflected; &ldquo;but they
can&rsquo;t quite kill me for it.&rdquo; The old lady rang her bell for tea, and
thought what a nice and pretty young gentlewoman Anne looked in
her plain black dress with its white frilling, and the handsome jet
necklace that had been her mother&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>But before the tea could be made, Sir Robert Tenby&rsquo;s horse trotted
up, and they heard him go to his sitting-room. Mrs. Macbean took
Anne into his presence, saying at the same time that she had been
about to give the young lady a cup of tea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like some tea, too,&rdquo; said Sir Robert; &ldquo;Miss Lewis can
take it with me. Send it in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It came in upon a waiter, and was placed upon the table. Anne,
at his request, put sugar and cream into his cup, handed it to him, and
then took her own. He was looking very thoughtful; she seemed to
fancy he had no good news for her, as he did not speak of it; and her
heart went down, down. In a very timid tone, she told him of the
depreciating opinion held of her talents at home, and begged him to
say what <em>he</em> thought, for she should not like to be guilty of undertaking
any duty she was not fully competent to fulfil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you take some more tea?&rdquo; was all Sir Robert said in answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another biscuit? No? We will send the tray away then.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>Ringing the bell, a servant came in and removed the things. Sir
Robert, standing at the window, and looking down at Anne as she sat,
began to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think there might be more difficulty in getting you a situation as
governess than we thought for; one that would be quite suited to you,
at least. Perhaps another kind of situation would do better for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her whole face, turned up to him with its gaze of expectancy,
changed to sadness; the light in her eyes died away. It seemed so
like the knell of all her hopes. Sir Robert only smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you could bring yourself to take it&mdash;and to like it,&rdquo; he continued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what situation is it, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That of my wife. That of Lady of Bellwood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just for a moment or two she simply stared at him. When his
meaning reached her comprehension, her face turned red and white
with emotion. Sir Robert took her hand and spoke more fully. He
had learnt to like her very very much, to esteem her, and wished her
to be his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am aware that there is a good deal of difference in our ages, my
dear; more than twenty years,&rdquo; he went on, while she sat in silence.
&ldquo;But I think you might find happiness with me; I will do my very
best to insure it. Better be my wife than a nursery governess. What
do you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, I do not know what to say,&rdquo; she answered, trembling a
little. &ldquo;It is so unexpected&mdash;and a great honour&mdash;and&mdash;and I am
overwhelmed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you like me?&rdquo; he gently asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do like you, sir; very much. But this&mdash;this would be different.
Perhaps you would let me take until to-morrow to think about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will. Bring me your answer then. Bring it yourself,
whatever it may be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, sir. And I thank you very greatly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All night long Anne Lewis lay awake. Should she take this good
man for her husband, or should she not? She did like him very much:
and what a position it would be for her; and how sheltered she would
be henceforth from the frowns of the world! Anne might never have
hesitated, but for the remains of her love for Mr. Angerstyne. That
was passing away from her heart day by day, as she knew; it would
soon have passed entirely. She could never feel that same love again;
it was over and done with for ever; but there was surely no reason why
she should sacrifice all her future to its remembrance. <em>Yes</em>: she would
accept Sir Robert Tenby: and would, by the help of Heaven, make him
a true, faithful, good wife.</p>

<p>It was nearly dusk the next afternoon before she could leave the
house. Mrs. Lewis had kept her in sight so long that she feared she might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
not find the opportunity that day. She ran all the way to Bellwood,
anxious to keep her promise: she could not bear to seem to trifle, even
for a moment, with this good and considerate man. Sir Robert was
waiting for her in a glow of firelight. He came forward, took both her
hands in his, and looked into her face inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, if you still wish to take me. I will try to be to you a
loving wife; obedient and faithful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a sigh of relief, he sat down on a sofa that was drawn to the
fire and placed her beside him, holding her hand still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, I thank you: you have made me very happy. You shall
<em>never</em> have cause to repent it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so strange,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;that you should wait all these
years, with the world to choose from, and then think of <em>me</em> at last! I
can scarcely believe it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, I suppose it is strange. But I must tell you something, Anne.
When quite a youth, only one-and-twenty, there was a young lady
whom I dearly loved. She was poor, and not of much family, and my
father forbade the union. She married some one else, and died. It is
for the love of her I have kept single all these years. But I shall not
make you the less good husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&mdash;I wish to tell you that <em>I</em> once cared for some one,&rdquo; whispered
Anne, in her straightforward honesty. &ldquo;It is all over and done
with; but I did like him very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, my dear, we shall be even,&rdquo; he said, with a merry smile.
&ldquo;The one cannot reproach the other. And now&mdash;this is the beginning
of April; before the month shall have closed you had better come to
me. We have nothing to wait for; and I do not like, now that you
belong to me, to leave you one moment longer than is needful with that
lady whom you are forced to call stepmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How Anne reached home that late afternoon she hardly knew: she
knew still less how to bring the news out. In the course of the following
morning she tried to do so, and made a bungle of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Robert not going to get you a situation as governess!&rdquo; interrupted
Julia, before Anne had half finished. &ldquo;Of course he is not.
He knows you are not capable of taking one. <em>I</em> thought how much he
was intending to help you. You must have had plenty of <em>cheek</em>, Anne,
to trouble him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to be his wife instead,&rdquo; said poor Anne, meekly. &ldquo;He
has asked me to be. And&mdash;and it is to be very soon; and he is coming
to see Mrs. Lewis this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lewis, sitting back in an easy-chair, her feet on the fender,
dropped the book she was reading to stare at Anne. Julia burst into a
laugh of incredulity. Her mother echoed it, and spoke&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You poor infatuated girl! This comes of being brought up on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
French soup. But Sir Robert Tenby has no right to play jokes upon
you. I shall write and tell him so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;think&mdash;he is there,&rdquo; stammered Anne.</p>

<p>There he was. A handsome carriage was drawing up to the gate,
the baronet&rsquo;s badge upon its panels. Sir Robert sat inside. A footman
came up the path and thundered at the door.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not very long afterwards&mdash;it was in the month of June&mdash;Anne and
her husband were guests at a London crush in Berkeley Square. It
was too crowded to be pleasant. Anne began to look tired, and Sir
Robert whispered to her that if she had had enough of it, they would
go home. &ldquo;Very gladly,&rdquo; she answered, and turned to say good-night
to her hostess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anne! How are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The unexpected interruption, in a voice she knew quite well, and
which sent a thrill through her, even yet, arrested Anne in her course.
There stood Henry Angerstyne, his hand held out in greeting, a confident
smile, as if assuming she could only receive him joyfully, on his
handsome face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so much surprised to see you here; so delighted to meet you
once again, Miss Lewis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mistake, sir,&rdquo; replied Anne, in a cold, proud tone, drawing her
head a little up. &ldquo;I am Lady Tenby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walking forward, she put her arm within her husband&rsquo;s, who waited
for her. Mr. Angerstyne understood it at once; it needed not the
almost bridal robes of white silk and lace to enlighten him. She was
not altered. She looked just the same single-minded, honest-hearted
girl as ever, with a pleasant word for all&mdash;except just in the moment
when she had spoken to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad of it: she deserves her good fortune,&rdquo; he thought heartily.
With all his faults, few men could be more generously just than Henry
Angerstyne.</p>

<h2><span class="f9">XV.</span><br />

THE KEY OF THE CHURCH.</h2>


<p>&ldquo;Johnny, you will have to take the organ on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words gave me a surprise. I turned short round on the music-stool,
wondering whether Mrs. Todhetley spoke in jest or earnest. But
her face was quite serious, as she sat, her hands on her lap, and her
lame finger&mdash;the fore-finger of the left hand&mdash;stretched out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take the organ, good mother! What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I was to have taken it, Johnny, and this accident to my
finger will prevent it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had just got home to Dyke Manor from school for the Michaelmas
holidays. Not a week of them: for this was Wednesday afternoon,
and we should go back the following Monday. Mrs. Todhetley had
cut her finger very seriously in carving some cold beef on the previous
day. Old Duffham had put it into splints.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Richards?&rdquo; I asked, alluding to the church organist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is rather a long tale, Johnny. A good deal of dissatisfaction
has existed, as you know, between him and the congregation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Through his loud playing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so. And now he has resigned in a huff. Mr. Holland called
yesterday morning to ask if I would help them at the pinch by taking
the organ for a Sunday or two, until matters were smoothed with
Richards, or some fresh organist was found; and I promised him I
would. In the evening, this accident happened to my finger. So you
must take it in my place, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I break down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not you. Why should you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am out of practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of time to get up your practice between now and
Sunday. Don&rsquo;t make objections, my dear. We should all do what
little we can to help others in a time of need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I said no more. As she observed, there was plenty of time between
now and Sunday. And, not to lose time, I went off there and then.</p>

<p>The church stood in a lonely spot, as I think you know, and I took
the way across the fields to it. Whistling softly, I went along, fixing
in my mind upon the chants and hymns. Ours was rather a primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
service. The organ repertoire included only about a dozen chants and
double that number of hymns. It had this advantage&mdash;that they were
all familiar to the congregation, who could join in the singing at will,
and the singers had no need to practise. Mr. Richards had lately
introduced a different style of music, and it was not liked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see: I&rsquo;ll make it just the opposite of Richards&rsquo;s. For the
morning we will have the thirty-seventh psalm, &lsquo;Depend on God:&rsquo;
there&rsquo;s real music in that; and &lsquo;Jerusalem the Golden.&rsquo; And for the
afternoon, &lsquo;Abide with me,&rsquo; and the Evening Hymn. Mornington&rsquo;s
Chant; and the Grand Chant; and the&mdash;&mdash; Halloa, Fred! Is it
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A lithe, straight-limbed young fellow was turning out of the little
valley: on his way (as I guessed) from the Parsonage. It was Fred
Westerbrook: old Westerbrook&rsquo;s nephew at the Narrow Dyke Farm&mdash;or,
as we abbreviated it, the N.&nbsp;D. Farm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His face and voice were alike subdued as he shook hands. I asked
after Mr. and Mrs. Westerbrook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are both well, for anything I know,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The
N.&nbsp;D. Farm is no longer my home, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Had he told me the Manor was no longer mine, I could not have
been more surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how is that, Fred?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have turned me out of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This morning&mdash;no. Two months ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why? I never thought it would come to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because they wanted to get rid of me, that&rsquo;s why. Gisby has been
the prime mover in it&mdash;the chief snake in the grass. He is worse than
she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing: except knocking about. I&rsquo;d be off to America to-morrow
and try my luck there if I had a fifty-pound note in my pocket. I
went up to the farm last week, and made an appeal to my uncle to help
me to it, and be rid of me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And would he?&rdquo; I interrupted, too eager to let him finish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Would he!</em>&rdquo; repeated Fred, savagely. &ldquo;He bade me go to a
place unmentionable. He threatened to drive me off the premises if
ever I put foot on them again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry. What shall you do?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven knows! Perhaps turn poacher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Fred!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Is</em> it nonsense!&rdquo; he retorted, taking off his low-crowned hat and
passing his hand passionately over his wavy, auburn hair&mdash;about the
nicest hair I ever saw. People said Fred was proud of it. He was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
good-looking young fellow altogether; with a clear, fresh face, and
steady grey eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what it is to be <em>goaded</em>, Johnny,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
can tell you I am ripe for any mischief. And a man must live. But
for one thing, I swear I wouldn&rsquo;t keep straight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I knew what thing he meant quite well. &ldquo;What does she say about
it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can she say? My uncle has insulted her to her face, and
made me out at the Parsonage to be a downright scamp. Oh, I go in
for all that&rsquo;s bad, according to him, I assure you, Johnny Ludlow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you never see her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is chiefly by chance if I do. I have just been up there now,
sitting for half-an-hour with her in the old study. There was no
opportunity for a private word, though; the young ones were dodging
around, playing at &lsquo;Salt Fish&rsquo;&mdash;if you know the delectable game.
Good-bye, Johnny lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He strode off with an angry fire in his eye. I felt very sorry for
him. We all liked Fred Westerbrook. He had his faults, I suppose,
but he was one of the most open-natured fellows in the world.</p>

<p>Dashing in at Clerk Bumford&rsquo;s for the key of the church, I sat down
to the organ: an antiquated instrument, whose bellows were worked
by the player&rsquo;s feet, as are some of the modern harmoniums; but, as
far as tone went, it was not bad&mdash;rather rich and sweet. All through
the practice my mind was running on Fred Westerbrook and his
uncle. The parish had said long ago they would come to a blow-up
some time.</p>

<p>The N.&nbsp;D. Farm stood about three-quarters of a mile on the other
side the church, beyond Mr. Page&rsquo;s. It had a good house upon it, and
consisted of two or three hundred acres of land. But its owner, Mr.
Westerbrook, rented a great deal more land that lay contiguous to it,
which rendered it altogether one of the most considerable farms round
about. Up to fifty years of age, Mr. Westerbrook had not married.
Fred, his dead brother&rsquo;s son, had been adopted by him, and was
regarded as his heir. The farm had been owned by the Westerbrooks
for untold-of years, and it was not likely a stranger in blood and name
would be allowed to inherit it. So Fred had lived there as the son
and heir, and been made much of.</p>

<p>But, to the surprise of every one, Mr. Westerbrook took it into his
head to marry, although he was fifty years old. It was thought to be
a foolish act, and the parish talked freely. She was a widow without
children, of a grasping nature, and not at all nice in temper. A high-spirited
boy of fourteen, as Fred was, would be hardly likely to get on
with her. She interfered with him in the holidays, and thwarted him,
and told sneaking tales of him to his uncle. It went on pretty smoothly
enough, however, until Fred left school, which he did at eighteen, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
take up his abode at home for good and busy himself about the farm.
Upon the death of the bailiff some three years later, she sent for one
Gisby, from a distance, and got Mr. Westerbrook to instal him in the
bailiff&rsquo;s vacant place. This Gisby was a dark little man of middle age,
and was said to be distantly related to her. He proved to be an
excellent farmer and manager, and did his duty well; but from the
first he and Fred were just at daggers-drawn. Presuming upon his
relationship to the mistress, Gisby treated Fred in an off-hand manner,
telling him sometimes to do this and not to do the other, as he did the
men. Of course, Fred did not stand that, and offered to pitch him into
next week unless he kept his place better.</p>

<p>But, as the years went on, the antagonism against Fred penetrated
to Mr. Westerbrook. She was always at work with her covert whispers,
as was Gisby with his outspoken accusations of him, and with all sorts
of tales of his wrong-doing. They had the ear of the master, and Fred
could not fight against it. Perhaps he did not try to do so. Whispering,
and meanness, and underhand doing of any kind, were foreign to
his nature; he was rather too outspoken, and he turned on his enemies
freely and gave them plenty of abuse. It was Gisby who first told Mr.
Westerbrook of the intimacy, or friendship, or whatever you may
please to call it, though I suppose the right word would be <em>love</em>, between
Fred and Edna Blake. Edna was one of a large family, and had
come, a year or two ago, to live at the Parsonage, being niece to Mrs.
Holland, the parson&rsquo;s wife. Mrs. Holland was generally ill (and
frightfully incapable), and Edna had it all on her hands: the housekeeping,
and the six unruly children, and the teaching and the
mending, and often the cooking. They paid her twenty pounds
a-year for it. But she was a charming girl, with one of the sweetest
faces ever seen, and the gentlest spirit. Fred Westerbrook had found
that out, and the two were deeply in love with one another. Old Mr.
Westerbrook went into one of his passions when he heard of it, and
swore at Fred. Edna was not his equal, he told him; Fred must look
higher: she had no money, and her friends, as was reported, were
only tradespeople. Fred retorted that Edna was a mine of wealth and
goodness in herself, and he had never troubled himself to ask what her
friends might be. However, to make short of the story, matters had
grown more unpleasant for Fred day by day, and this appeared to be
the end of it, turning him out of house and home. He was just
twenty-four now. I don&rsquo;t wish to imply that Fred was without faults,
or that he did nothing to provoke his uncle. He had been wild the last
year or two, and tumbled into a few scrapes; but the probability is that
he would have kept straight enough under more favourable circumstances.
The discomfort at home drove him out, and he got associating
with anything but choice company.</p>

<p>Making short work of my playing, I took the key back to Bumford&rsquo;s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
and ran home. Tod was in the dining-room with the mother, and I
told them of the meeting with Fred Westerbrook. Mrs. Todhetley
seemed to know all about it, and said Fred had been living at the
Silver Bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an awful shame of old Westerbrook!&rdquo; broke out Tod. &ldquo;To
turn a fellow away from his home!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid there are faults on both sides,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Todhetley,
in her gentle way. &ldquo;Fred has not borne a good character of late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who could expect him to bear a good one?&rdquo; fired Tod. &ldquo;If I
were turned out like a dog, should I care what I did? No! Old
Westerbrook and that precious wife of his ought to be kicked. As to
Gisby, the sneak, hanging would be too good for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Joseph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Don&rsquo;t!</em>&rdquo; retorted Tod. &ldquo;But I do. They deserve all the abuse
that can be given them. I can see her game. She wants Westerbrook
to leave the property to her: that&rsquo;s the beginning and the end of it;
and to cut off poor Fred with a shilling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we are all sorry for Fred, Joseph,&rdquo; resumed the mother.
&ldquo;Very sorry. I know I am. But he need not do reckless things, and
lose his good name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bother his good name!&rdquo; cried Tod. &ldquo;Look at their interference
about Edna Blake. That news came out when we were at home at
Midsummer. Edna is as good as they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a hopeless case, I fear, Joseph. Discarded by his uncle, all
his prospects are at an end. He has been all on the wrong track
lately, and done many a sad thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what he has done. He has been driven to it. And
I&rsquo;ll stand up for him through thick and thin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod flung out of the room with the last words. It was just like him,
putting himself into a way for nothing. It was like somebody else too&mdash;his
father. I began telling Mrs. Todhetley of the chants and hymns
I had thought of, asking her if they would do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None could be better, Johnny. And I only wish you might play
for us always.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A fine commotion arose next morning. We were at breakfast, when
Thomas came in to say old Jones, the constable, wanted to see the
Squire immediately. Old Jones was bade to enter; he appeared all on
the shake, and his face as white as a sheet. There had been murder
done in the night, he said. Master Fred Westerbrook had shot Gisby:
and he had come to get a warrant signed for Fred&rsquo;s apprehension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness bless me!&rdquo; cried the Squire, dropping his knife and fork,
and turning to face old Jones. &ldquo;How on earth did it happen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, your worship, &rsquo;twere a poaching affray,&rdquo; returned Jones.
&ldquo;Gisby the bailiff have had his suspicions o&rsquo; the game, and he went
out last night with a man or two, and met the fellows in the open field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
on this side the copse. There they was, in the bright moonlight, as
bold as brass, with a bag o&rsquo; game, Master Fred Westerbrook the foremost
on &rsquo;em. A fight ensued&mdash;Gisby don&rsquo;t want for pluck, he don&rsquo;t,
though he be undersized, and he attacked &rsquo;em. Master Fred up with
his gun and shot him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Gisby dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; but he&rsquo;s a-dying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a fool that Fred Westerbrook must be!&rdquo; stormed the Squire.
&ldquo;And I declare I liked the young fellow amazingly! It was only last
night, Jones, that we were talking of him here, taking his part against
his uncle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He haven&rsquo;t been after much good, Squire, since he went to live at
that there Silver Bear. Not but what the inn&rsquo;s as respectable&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Respectable!&mdash;I should like to know where you would find a more
respectable inn, or one better conducted?&rdquo; put in Tod, with scant
ceremony. &ldquo;What do you mean, old Jones? A gentleman can take
up his abode at the Silver Bear, and not be ashamed of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say again&rsquo; it, sir; nor against Rimmer neither.
It warn&rsquo;t the inn I was reflecting on, but on Master Fred himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I don&rsquo;t believe this tale, Jones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not believe it!&rdquo; returned Jones, aghast at the bold assertion.
&ldquo;Why, young Mr. Todhetley, the whole parish is a-ringing with it.
There&rsquo;s Gisby a-dying at Shepherd&rsquo;s&mdash;which was the place he were
carried to, being the nearest; and Shepherd himself saw young Mr.
Fred fire off the gun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What became of the rascally poachers?&rdquo; asked the Squire. &ldquo;Who
were they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They got clean off, sir, every one on &rsquo;em. And they couldn&rsquo;t be
recognized; they had blackened their faces. Master Fred was the
only one who had not disguised hisself, which was just like his boldness.
They left the game behind &rsquo;em, your worship: a nice lot o&rsquo;
pheasants and partridges. Pheasants too, the miscreants!&mdash;and October
not in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was not much more breakfast for us. Tod rushed off, and I
after him. As Jones had said, the whole parish was ringing with the
news, and we found people standing about in groups to talk. The particulars
appeared to be as old Jones had related. Gisby, taking
Shepherd&mdash;who was herdsman on the N.&nbsp;D. Farm&mdash;with him, and
another man named Ford, had gone out to watch for poachers; had
met half-a-dozen of them, including Fred Westerbrook, and Fred had
shot Gisby.</p>

<p>The Silver Bear stood in the middle of Church Dykely, next door to
Perkins the butcher&rsquo;s. It was kept by Henry Rimmer. We made for
it, wondering whether Rimmer could tell us anything. He was in the
tap-room, polishing the taps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s true enough, young gentlemen!&rdquo; he said, as we burst in
upon him with questions. &ldquo;And a dreadful thing it is. One can&rsquo;t
help pitying young Mr. Westerbrook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Rimmer: do you believe he did it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, in course he did, Master Johnny. There was no difficulty in
knowing him: he was the only one of &rsquo;em not disguised. Shepherd
says the night was as light as day. Gisby and him and Ford all saw
young Mr. Westerbrook, and knew him as soon as the lot came in
sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he at home here last evening?&rdquo; asked Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was at home here, sir, till after supper. He had been out in
the afternoon, and came in to his tea between five and six. Then he
stayed in till supper-time, and went out afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he come in later?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, never,&rdquo; replied Rimmer, lowering his voice, as a man sometimes
does when speaking very seriously. &ldquo;He never came in again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say Gisby can&rsquo;t recover. Is that true, or not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is thought he&rsquo;ll not live through the day, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where can Westerbrook be hiding himself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s safe inside the hut of one or other of the poachers, I should
say,&rdquo; nodded the landlord. &ldquo;Not that that would be safe for him, or
for them, if it could be found out who the villains were. I think I
could give a guess at two or three of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So could I,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;Dick Standish was one, I know. And
Jelf another. Of course, their haunts will be searched. Don&rsquo;t you
think, Rimmer, Mr. Fred Westerbrook would rather make off, than run
the risk of concealing himself in any one of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rimmer shook his head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that, sir. He might
not be able to make off. It&rsquo;s thought he was wounded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wounded!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gisby fired his own gun in the act of falling, and Shepherd thinks
the charge hit young Mr. Westerbrook. The poachers were running
off then, and Shepherd saw them halt in a kind of heap like, and he is
positive that the one on the ground was Mr. Westerbrook. For that
reason, sir, I should say the chances are he is somewhere in the
neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course it looked like it. Strolling away to pick up anything else
that people might be saying, we gave Fred our best wishes for his
escape&mdash;in spite of the shot&mdash;and for effectually dodging old Jones and
the rest of the Philistines. Tod made no secret of his sentiments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thing that might have happened to you or to me, you see,
Johnny, were we turned out of doors and driven to bay as Fred has
been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the afternoon, great staring hand-bills were posted about, written
in enormous text-hand, offering a reward of twenty pounds for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
apprehension of Frederick Westerbrook. When old Westerbrook was
incensed, he went in for the whole thing, and no mistake.</p>

<p>What with the bustle the place was in, and the excitement of the
chase&mdash;for all the hedges and ditches, the barns and the suspected
dwellings were being looked up by old Jones and a zealous crowd,
anxious for the reward&mdash;it was not until after dinner in the evening
that I got away to practice. Going along, I met Duffham, and asked
after Gisby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am on my way to Shepherd&rsquo;s now,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I suppose
he is still alive, as they have not sent me word to the contrary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he sure to die, Mr. Duffham?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear so, Johnny. I don&rsquo;t see much chance of saving him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a dreadful thing for Fred Westerbrook! They may bring it
in wilful murder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That they will be sure to do. Good-evening, lad; I have no time
to linger with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bumford was probably looking out for the fugitive (and the reward)
on his own score, as he was not to be seen; but I found the key inside
the knife-box on the kitchen dresser, his store-place for it, opened the
door, and went into the church.</p>

<p>On one side the church-door, as you entered, was an enclosed place
underneath the belfry, that did for the vestry and for Clerk Bumford&rsquo;s
den. He kept his store of candles in it, his grave-digging tools (for he
was sexton as well as clerk), his Sunday black gown, and other choice
articles. On the other side of the door, not enclosed, was the nook
that contained the organ. I sat down at once. But I had come too
late; for in half-an-hour&rsquo;s time the notes of the music and the keys were
alike dim. Just then Bumford entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you be here, be you!&rdquo; said he, treating me, as he did the rest
of the world, with slight ceremony. &ldquo;I thought I heered the organ
a-going, so I come on to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were not indoors, Bumford, when I called for the key.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I were only in the field at the back, a-getting up some dandelion
roots,&rdquo; returned old Bumford, in his usual resentful tone. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t
no obligation in me to be shut in at home everlasting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who said there was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it a&rsquo;most too dark for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall have to borrow one of your candles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bumford grunted at this. The candles were not strictly his; they
were paid for by the parish; but he set great store by them, and would
have denied me one if he could. Not seeing his way clear to doing
this, he turned away, muttering to himself. I took my fingers off the
keys&mdash;for I had been playing while I talked to him&mdash;and followed.
Bumford went out of the church, shutting the door with a bang, and I
proceeded to search for the candlestick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>That was soon found: it always stood on the shelf; but it had no
candle in it, and I opened the candle-box to take one out. All the light
that came in was from the open slits in the belfry above. The next
thing was to find the matches.</p>

<p>Groping about quietly with my hands on the shelf, for fear of knocking
down some article or another, and wondering where on earth the
match-box had gone to, I was interrupted by a groan. A dismal groan,
coming from the middle of the church.</p>

<p>It nearly made me start out of my skin. My shirt-sleeves went damp.
Down with us, the ghosts of the buried dead are popularly supposed to
haunt the churches at night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been the pulpit creaking,&rdquo; said I, gravely to myself.
&ldquo;Oh, here&rsquo;s the match&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>An awful groan! Another! Three groans altogether! I stood as
still as death; calling up the recollection that God was with me inside
the church as well as out of it. Frightened I was, and it is of no use
to deny it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what the devil is to be the ending of this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The unorthodox words burst upon my ears, bringing a reassurance,
for dead people don&rsquo;t talk, let alone their natural objection (as one must
suppose) to mention the arch-enemy. The tones were free and distinct;
and&mdash;I knew them for Fred Westerbrook&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fred, is that you?&rdquo; I asked in a half-whisper, as I went forward.</p>

<p>No sound; no answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fred! it&rsquo;s only I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not a word or a breath. I struck a match, and lighted a candle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not be afraid, Fred. Come along. I&rsquo;ll do anything I
can for you. Don&rsquo;t you know me?&mdash;Johnny Ludlow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the love of Heaven, put that light out, Johnny!&rdquo; he said, feeling
it perhaps useless to hold out, or else deciding to trust me, as he
came down the aisle in a stooping position, so that the pews might
screen him from the windows. And I put it out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you had gone out of the church with old Bumford,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;I heard you both come away from the organ, and then the door
was slammed, leaving the church to silence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was searching after the candle and matches. When did you
come here, Fred? How did you get in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got in last night. Is there much of a row, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty well. How came you to do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To do what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shoot Gisby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not I that shot him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;people are saying it was you. You were with the poachers.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I was with the poachers; and one of them, like the confounded
idiot that he was, pointed his gun and fired it. I recognized the cry
for Gisby&rsquo;s, and knew that the charge must have struck him. I never
had a gun in my hand at all, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, I felt thankful for that. We sat down on the bench, and Fred
told his tale.</p>

<p>After supper the previous night, he strolled out and met some fellow
he knew, who lived two or three miles away. (A black sheep in public
estimation, like himself.) It was a beautiful night. Fred chose to see
him home, and stayed there, drinking a glass or two, till he knew not
what hour. Coming back across the fields, he fell in with the poachers.
Instead of denouncing them, he told them half in joke, half in earnest,
that he might be joining their band himself before the winter was over.
Close upon that, they fell in with the watchers, Gisby and the rest.
Fred knew he was recognized, for Gisby called out his name; and that,
Fred did not like: it made things look black against him. Gisby
attacked them; a scuffle ensued, and one of the poachers used his gun.
Then the poachers turned to run, Fred with them; a shot was fired
after them and hit one of their body&mdash;but not Fred, as Rimmer had
supposed. The man tripped as the shot struck him, and caused Fred
to trip and fall; but both were up, and off, the next moment. Where
the rest escaped to, Fred did not know; chance led him past the church:
on the spur of the moment he entered it for refuge, and had been there
ever since.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it is a great and good thing you did enter it, Fred,&rdquo; I said
eagerly. &ldquo;Gisby swears it was you who shot him, and he is dying;
and Shepherd swears it too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gisby dying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is. I met Duffham as I came here; he told me there was little,
if any, chance of his life; he had been expecting news of his death all
the afternoon. They have posted handbills up, offering a reward of
twenty pounds for your apprehension, Fred; and&mdash;and I am afraid, and
so is Duffham, that they will try you for wilful murder. The whole
neighbourhood is being searched for you for miles round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pleasant!&rdquo; said Fred, after a brief silence. &ldquo;I had meant to go
out to-night and endeavour to ascertain how the land lay. Of course I
knew that what could be put upon my back would be put; and there&rsquo;s
no denying that I was with the poachers. But I did not think matters
would be as bad as this. Hang it all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Fred, how did you get in here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we hear talk of providential occurrences: there&rsquo;s
nothing Mr. Holland is fonder of telling us about in his sermons than
the guiding finger of God. If the means that enabled me to take refuge
here were not providential, Johnny, I must say they looked like it.
When I met you yesterday afternoon, you must remember my chancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
to say that the little Hollands were playing at &lsquo;Salt Fish&rsquo; in the study,
while I sat there, talking to Edna?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course I remembered it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Directly after I left you, Johnny,&rdquo; resumed Fred Westerbrook, &ldquo;I
put my hand in my coat-tail pocket for my handkerchief, and found
a large key there. It was the key of the church, that the children
had been hiding at their play; and I understood in a moment that
Charley, whose turn it was to hide last, had made a hiding-place of
my pocket. The parson keeps one key, you know, and Bumford the
other&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Fred,&rdquo; I interrupted, the question striking me, &ldquo;how came the
young ones to let you come away with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, lad, their attention got diverted to something else. Ann
brought in the tea-things, with a huge plate of bread-and-treacle: they
screamed out in delight, and scuffled to get seats round the table.
Well, I let the key lie in my pocket,&rdquo; went on Fred, &ldquo;intending to
take it back to-day. In the night, when flying from pursuit, not knowing
who or how many might be after me, I felt this heavy key strike
against me continually; and, in nearing the church, the thought flashed
over me like an inspiration: What if I open it and hide there? Just as
young Charley had hidden the key in my pocket, so I hid myself, by its
means, in the church.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking a minute to think over what he said, it did seem strange.
One of those curious things one can hardly account for; the means for
his preservation were so simply natural and yet almost marvellous.
Perhaps the church was the only building where he could have found
secure refuge. Private dwellings would refuse to shelter him, and
other places were sure to be searched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are safe here, Fred. No one would ever think of seeking you
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Safe, yes; but for how long? I can&rsquo;t live without food for ever,
Johnny. As it is, I have eaten none since last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My goodness! A shock of remorse came over me. When I was at
old Bumford&rsquo;s knife-box, a loaf of bread stood on the dresser. If I had
only secured it!</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must manage to bring you something, Fred. You cannot stir
from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fred had taken the key out, having returned it to his pocket in the
night when he locked himself in. He sat looking at it as he balanced
it on his finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have served me in good need,&rdquo; he said to the key. &ldquo;I
shall turn out for a stroll during some quiet hour of the night, Johnny.
To keep my restless legs curbed indoors for a whole day and night
would be quite beyond their philosophy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, take care of yourself, if you do. There&rsquo;s not a soul in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
place but is wild for the reward; and I dare say they will look for you
by night more than by day. How about getting you in something to
eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It would never do for you to be
seen coming in here at night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I knew that. Old Bumford would be down on me if no one else was.
I sat turning over possibilities in my mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will come in betimes to-morrow morning under the plea of
practising, Fred, and bring what I can. You must do battle with your
hunger until then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I must, Johnny. Mind you lock the door when you
come in, or old Bumford might pounce upon us. When I heard you
unlock it on coming in this evening, I can tell you I shivered in my
shoes. Fate is very hard,&rdquo; he added, after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fate is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. I have been a bit wild lately, perhaps, savage too, but
I declare before Heaven that I have committed no crime, and did not
mean to commit any. And now, to have this serious thing fastened
upon my back! The world will say I have gone straight over to
Satan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did not see how he would get it off his back either. Wishing him
good-night and a good heart, I turned to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment, Johnny. Let me go back to my hiding-place
first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went swiftly up the aisle, lighter now than it had been, for the
moonlight was streaming in at the windows. Locking the church
safely, I crossed the graveyard to old Bumford&rsquo;s. He was seated at his
round table at supper: bread-and-cheese, and beer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Bumford, as I have to come into the church very early in
the morning, or I shall never get my music up for Sunday, I will take
the key home with me. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shouted out fifteen denials: How dared I think of taking the key
out of his custody! But I was conveniently deaf, rushed off, and left
him shouting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a long practice you have been taking, Johnny!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Todhetley. &ldquo;And how hot you look. You must have run very
fast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Squire turned round from his arm-chair. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been joining
in the hunt after that scamp, Mr. Johnny;&mdash;you&rsquo;ve not been in the
church, sir, all this time. I hear there&rsquo;s a fine pack out, scouring the
hedges and ditches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got a candle from old Bumford&rsquo;s den,&rdquo; said I, evasively. And
presently I contrived to whisper unseen to Tod&mdash;who sat reading&mdash;to
come outside. Standing against the wall of the pigeon-house, I told
him all. For once in his life Tod was astonished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What a stunning thing!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Good luck, Fred! we&rsquo;ll
help you. I knew he was innocent, Johnny. Food? Yes, of course;
we must get it for him. Molly, you say? Molly be shot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know what Molly is, Tod. Let half a grain of suspicion
arise, and it might betray him. If she saw us rifling her larder, she
would go straight to the Squire; and what excuse should we have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Johnny. I&rsquo;ll go out fishing to-morrow, you understand,
and order her to make a lot of meat pasties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he must have something to eat to-morrow morning, Tod: he
might die of hunger, else, before night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod nodded. He had little more diplomacy than the Squire, and
would have liked to perch himself upon the highest pillar in the parish
there and then, and proclaim Fred Westerbrook&rsquo;s innocence.</p>

<p>We stole round to the kitchen. Supper was over, but the servants
were still at the table; no chance of getting to the larder then. Molly
was in one of her tempers, apparently blowing up Thomas. There
might be more chance in the morning.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Morning light. Tod went downstairs with the dawn, and I followed
him. Not a servant was yet astir. He laid hold of a great tray, lodged
it on the larder-floor, and began putting some things upon it&mdash;a cold
leg of mutton and a big round loaf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take in all <em>that</em>, Tod. It is daylight, you know, and eyes
may be about: old Bumford&rsquo;s are sure to be. I can only take in what
can be concealed in my pockets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother, Johnny! You&rsquo;d half famish him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better half famish him than betray him. Some slices of bread and
meat will be best&mdash;thick sandwiches, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We soon cut into the mutton and the bread. Wrapping them in
paper, I stowed the thick slices away in my pockets, leaving the rest of
the loaf and meat on the shelves again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I wish I could smuggle him in a bottle of beer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you can, Johnny. Swear to old Bumford it is for your own
drinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would know better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wrap a sheet of music round the bottle, then. He could make
nothing of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hunting out a bottle, we went down to the cellar. Tod stooped to fill
it from the tap. I stood watching the process.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve caught you, Master Johnny, have I! What be you about
there, letting the ale run, I&rsquo;d like to know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words were Molly&rsquo;s. She had come down and found us out:
suspecting something, I suppose, from seeing the cellar-door open. Tod
rose up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am drawing some beer to take out with me. Is it any business of
yours? When it is, you may interfere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was nobody in the household&mdash;never turning upon them. She&rsquo;d
have gone on at me for an hour, and probably walked off with the beer.
Tod was altogether different. He held his own authority, even with
Molly. She went up the cellar-stairs, grumbling to herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want a cork for this bottle,&rdquo; said bold Tod, following her. And
Molly, opening some receptacle of hers with a jerk, perforce found him
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, and I shall want some meat pasties made to-day, for I think of
going fishing,&rdquo; went on Tod. &ldquo;Let them be ready by lunch-time. I
have cut myself some slices of meat to go on with&mdash;if you chance to
miss any mutton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molly, never answering, left her kitchen-grate, where she was
beginning to crack up the huge flat piece of coal that the fire had been
raked with the previous night, and stalked into the larder to see what
depredations had been done. We tied up the bottle in paper on the
parlour-table, and then wrapped it in a sheet of loose music. It looked
a pretty thick roll; but nobody would be likely to remark that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a great mind to go with you and see him, Johnny,&rdquo; said
Tod, as we went together down the garden-path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, Tod!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, don&rsquo;t. You know
you never do go in with me, and it might cause old Bumford to
wonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;ll leave it till after dark to-night, Johnny. Go in then, I
shall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bumford was astir, but not down yet. I heard him coughing, through
his open casement; for I went with a purpose round the path by his
house, and called out to him. He looked out in his shirt-sleeves and a
cotton night-cap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see how early I am this morning. I&rsquo;ll bring you the key when
I leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eugh!&rdquo; growled Bumford. &ldquo;No rights to ha&rsquo; took it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Locking the church-door securely after me, I went down the aisle,
calling softly to Fred. He came forward from a dark, high-walled pew
behind a pillar, where he had slept. You should have seen him devour
the bread and meat, if you&rsquo;d like to know what hunger means, and
drink the bottle of beer. I sat down to practise. Had old Bumford
not heard the sound of the organ, he might have come thundering at
the door to know what I was about, and what the silence meant. Fred
came with me, and we talked whilst I played. About the first question
he asked was whether Gisby was dead; but I could not tell him. He
said he had gone out cautiously in the night and walked about the
churchyard for an hour, thinking over what he could do. &ldquo;And I
really had an unpleasant adventure, Johnny,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was pacing the path under the hedge towards Bumford&rsquo;s, when
all at once there arose the sound of voices and steps on the other side
of it&mdash;fellows on the look-out for me, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I held my breath. &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crouched down as well as I could&mdash;fortunately the hedge is high&mdash;and
came softly and swiftly over the grass and the graves to the porch.
I only slipped inside just in time, Johnny: before I could close the
door, the men were in the churchyard. The key has a trick of creaking
harshly when turned in the lock, you know; and I declare I thought
they must have heard it then, for it made a fearful noise, and the night
was very still!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they did not hear it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose not. But it was some minutes, I can tell you, before my
pulses calmed down to their ordinary rate of beating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went on to say that the only plan he could think of was to
endeavour to get away from the neighbourhood, and go out of the
country. To stand his trial was not to be thought of. His word, that
he had not been the guilty man, had never even had a gun in his hand
that night, would go for nothing, against Gisby&rsquo;s word and Shepherd&rsquo;s.
Whatever came of it, he would have to be out of the church before
Sunday. The great question was: how could he get away unseen?
I told him Tod was coming with me at night, and we would consult
together. Locking up the church again, and the prisoner in it, I
gladdened Bumford&rsquo;s heart by handing over the key, and ran home to
breakfast.</p>

<p>Life yet lingered in Gisby; but the doctors thought he could not
live through the day. The injury he had received was chiefly internal,
somewhere in the region of the lungs. Fresh parties went out with
fresh ardour to scour the country after Fred Westerbrook; and so the
day passed. Chancing to meet Shepherd late in the afternoon, he told
me Gisby still lived.</p>

<p>At sundown I went in to practise again, and took a big mould-candle
with me, showing it to Bumford, that he might not be uneasy
on the score of his stock in the vestry. As soon as dusk came on, and
before the tell-tale moon was much up, I left the organ, opened the
church-door, and stood at it, according to the plan concerted with Tod.
He came swiftly up with his basket of provisions which he had got
together by degrees during the day; and then we locked the door
again. After Fred had regaled himself, we consulted together. Fred
was to steal out of the church about one o&rsquo;clock on Sunday morning,
and make off across the country. But to do this with safety it was
necessary he should be disguised. By that time the ardour of the
night-searching might have somewhat passed; and the hour, one
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, was as silent and lonely a one as could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
expected. It was most essential that he should not be recognized by
any person who might chance to meet him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you must manage one thing for me,&rdquo; said Fred, after this was
settled. &ldquo;I will not go away without seeing Edna. She can come in
here with you to-morrow night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We both objected. &ldquo;It will be very hazardous, Fred. Old Bumford
would be sure to see her: his eyes are everywhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him you want her to sing over the chants with you, Johnny.
Tell him anything. But go away for an indefinite period, without first
seeing her and convincing her that it is not guilt that sends me, I will
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So there was no more to be said.</p>

<p>Getting provisions together seemed to have been easy compared with
what we should have to get up now&mdash;a disguise. A smock-frock, say,
and the other items of a day-labourer&rsquo;s apparel. But it was more easy
to decide than to procure them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mack leaves belongings of his in the barn occasionally,&rdquo; said
Tod to me, as we walked home together. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look to-morrow
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was our best hope. Failing that, there would be no possibility
of getting a smock-frock anywhere; and Fred would have to escape in
his coat turned inside out, or something of that sort. His own trousers,
braced up high, and plastered with mud at the feet, would do very well,
and his own wideawake hat, pulled low down on his face. There
would be no more trouble about provisions, for what Tod had taken in
would be enough.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Saturday. And Tod and I with our work before us. Gisby was
sinking fast.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon I went to the Parsonage, wondering how I
should get to see Edna Blake alone. But Fortune favoured me&mdash;as it
seemed to have favoured us throughout. The children were all at play
in the nearest field. Edna was in what they called the schoolroom in
her lilac-print dress, looking over socks and stockings, about a wheelbarrow-full.
I saw her through the window, and went straight in.
Her large dark eyes looked as sad and big as the hole she was darning;
and her voice had a hopeless ring in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Johnny, how you startled me! Nay, don&rsquo;t apologize. It is
my fault for being so nervous and foolish. I can&rsquo;t think what has ailed
me the last few days: I seem to start at shadows. Have&mdash;have you
come to tell me anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the shrinking voice and manner, I knew what she feared&mdash;that
Fred Westerbrook was taken. Looking round the room, I asked
whether what we said could be heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one to hear,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Poor Mrs. Holland is in
bed. Mr. Holland is out; and Anne is shut up, cleaning the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; I said, dropping my voice, &ldquo;I have brought you a
message from Fred Westerbrook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down went the socks in a heap. &ldquo;Oh, Johnny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! No: he is not taken; he is in safe hiding. What&rsquo;s more,
Edna, he is no more guilty than I am. He met the poachers accidentally
that night just before the affray, and he never had a gun in his hands
at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A prolonged, sobbing sigh, as if she were going to faint, and then a
glad light in her eyes. She took up her work again. I went over to
the seat next her, and told her all. She was darning all the while.
With such a heap of mending the fingers must not be idle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To America!&rdquo; she repeated, in answer to what I said. &ldquo;What is
he going to do for money to carry him there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He talks of working his passage over. He has enough money about
him, he says, to take him to the coast. Unfortunately, neither Tod
nor I can help him in that respect. We have brought empty pockets
from school, and shall have no money before the time of going back
again. Will you go in and see him, Edna?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, after a minute&rsquo;s consideration. &ldquo;And I will bring
a roll of music in my hand, as you suggest, Johnny, for the satisfaction
of Clerk Bumford&rsquo;s curiosity. I will be at the stile as near eight o&rsquo;clock
as I can, if you will come out there to meet me: but it is Saturday
night, you know, when there&rsquo;s always a great deal to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dinner was made later than usual that night at home: it had struck
half-past seven before we got out, having secured another bottle of
beer. The moon was rising behind the trees as we went into the barn.</p>

<p>Tod struck a match, and we looked about. Yes, Fortune was with
us still. Hanging on the shaft of the cart, was Mack&rsquo;s smock-frock.
It was anything but clean; but beggars can&rsquo;t be choosers. Next we
descried a cotton neckerchief and a pair of boots; two clumsy, clod-hopping
boots, with nails in the soles, and the outside leather not to be
seen for patches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must do,&rdquo; said Tod, with a rueful look. &ldquo;But just look at
the wretches, Johnny. I must smuggle these and the smock-frock into
the church-porch, whilst you go round to old B.&rsquo;s for the key.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the key. I flung him a shilling this morning instead of the
key, saying I might be wanting to practise at any hour to-day, and
would give it him back to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Going by the most solitary way, I let Tod into the church, and went
to meet Edna Blake. She was already there, the roll of music in her
hand. Bumford shot out of his house, and crossed our path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, Mr. Bumford!&rdquo; said she, cheerily. &ldquo;I am come to
try the hymns for to-morrow, with Johnny Ludlow.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d need to be sum&rsquo;at extra, they had, with all this here fuss of
practising,&rdquo; returned Bumford, ungraciously. &ldquo;Is the parson at home,
Miss Blake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He is in the little room, writing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cause I want to see him,&rdquo; said the clerk; and he stalked off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know how Gisby is?&rdquo; Edna asked me in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead by this time, I dare say. But I have not heard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were at the top of the church when we got in, laughing in
covert tones; I guessed it was over those dreadful boots. Edna stood
by me whilst I locked the door, and then we went at once to the organ
and began the hymn. Old Bumford could not be too far off yet to
catch the sounds. Presently Fred Westerbrook and Edna went into
the aisle, and paced it arm-in-arm. I kept on playing; Tod, not
knowing what to do with himself, whistled an accompaniment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long shall I be away, Edna!&rdquo; exclaimed Fred, in answer to
her question. &ldquo;Why, how can I tell? It may be for years; it may
be for ever. I cannot come back, I suppose, whilst this thing is hanging
over my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was in very low spirits, and the tears began to drop from her
eyes. Fred could see that much, as they paced through one of the
patches of moonlight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may not succeed in getting away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I may not. And do you know, Edna, there are moments when
I feel half inclined not to attempt it, but to give myself up instead, and
let the matter take its course. If I do get away, and get on in the
States, so as to make myself a home, will you come out and share it
with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may do it. I think I shall. Few people know more about the
cultivation of land than I do, and I will take care to put my shoulder to
the wheel. Practical farmers get on well there if they choose, though
they have to rough it at first. Be very sure of one thing, Edna: all
my hopes and aims will be directed to one end&mdash;that of making a home
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She could not speak for crying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may not be a luxurious home, neither may I make anything of
a position. But if I make enough for comfort, you will come out
to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; she said with a sob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My darling!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Echo bore the words to us, softly though they were spoken. I
played a crashing chord or two, after the manner of Richards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may not hear from me,&rdquo; continued Fred. &ldquo;I must not give
any clue to where I am, and therefore cannot write&mdash;at least, not at
present. Men accused of murder can be brought home from any part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
of the world. Only trust me, Edna. <em>Trust me!</em> though it be for
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No fear but she would. She put a small packet in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>must</em> take it, Frederick. It is my last half-year&rsquo;s salary&mdash;ten
pounds&mdash;and I chance to have it by me: a loan, if you will; but take
it you shall. Knowing that you have a few pounds to help you
away and to fall back upon, will make things a little less miserable for
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Edna&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I declare I will throw it away if you do not take it,&rdquo; she returned,
warmly. &ldquo;Do not be cruel to me, Frederick. If you knew how it will
lighten my doubts and fears, you would not for a moment hesitate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be it so, Edna. It will help me onwards. Truth to say, I did not
see how I should have got along, even to the coast, unless I had begged
on my way. It is a loan, Edna, and I will contrive to repay it as soon
as may be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So his boast of having money to take him to the coast had been all
a sham. Poor Fred! They began to take leave of one another, Edna
sobbing bitterly. I plunged into the &ldquo;Hallelujah Chorus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod let her out, and watched her safely across the churchyard.
Then we locked the door again for the dressing-up, I playing a fugue
between whiles. The first operation was that of cutting his hair short,
for which we had brought the mater&rsquo;s big scissors. No labourer would
be likely to possess Fred&rsquo;s beautiful hair, or wear it so long. Tod did
it well; not counting a few notches, and leaving him as good as none
on his head.</p>

<p>It was impossible to help laughing when we took a final look at him
in the moonlight, Fred turning himself about to be inspected: his hair,
clipped nearly to the roots, suggesting a suspicion that he had just
come out of prison; his trousers, not reaching to the ankle, showing off
the heavy, patched, disreputable boots; the smock-frock; and Mack&rsquo;s
spotted cotton neckerchief muffled round his chin!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your own mother wouldn&rsquo;t know you, Fred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a figure I shall cut if I am dropped upon and brought back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take heart, man!&rdquo; cried Tod. &ldquo;Resolve to get off, and you will
get off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Fred, I think you will. You have been so <em>helped</em> hitherto,
that I think you will be helped still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Johnny. Thank you both. I <em>will</em> take heart. And
if I live to return, I hope I shall thank you better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later we dared not stay; it was past nine now. I bade Fred good-bye,
and God-speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Between half-past twelve and one, mind, will be your time; you&rsquo;ll
hear the clock strike,&rdquo; was Tod&rsquo;s parting injunction, given in a whisper.
&ldquo;Good luck to you, old fellow! I hope and trust you&rsquo;ll dodge the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
enemy. And as soon as you are clear of the churchyard, make off as
if the dickens were behind you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the key, Mr. Bumford,&rdquo; I said, while Tod stole off with his
bundle the other way, Fred&rsquo;s boots, and hair, and all that. &ldquo;You
won&rsquo;t be bothered for it next week, for I shall be off to school again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thought you&rsquo;d took up your lodging inside for the night,&rdquo; grunted
Bumford. &ldquo;Strikes me, Master Ludlow, it&rsquo;s more play nor work with
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As it is with a good many of us, Bumford. Good-night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We walked home in the moonlight, silent enough, Tod handing me
the bundles to carry. The Squire attacked us, demanding whether we
had stayed out to look at the moon.</p>

<p>And I tossed and turned on my restless bed till the morning hours,
thinking of poor Fred Westerbrook, and of whether he would get away.
When sleep at last came, it brought me a very vivid dream of him. I
thought he did <em>not</em> get away: he was unable to unlock the church-door.
Whether Tod and I had double-locked it in leaving, I knew not; but
Fred could not get it open. When Clerk Bumford entered the church
in the morning, and the early comers of the congregation with him,
there stood Fred, hopelessly waiting to be taken. I saw him as plainly
in my dream as I had ever seen him in reality: with the dirty smock-frock,
and the patched boots, and the clipped hair. Shepherd, who
seemed to follow me in, darted forward and seized him; and in the
confusion I awoke. Just for a minute I thought it was true&mdash;a scene
actually enacted. Would it prove so?</p>

THE SYLLABUB FEAST.</h2>


<p>&ldquo;You have gone and done a fine thing, Master Johnny Ludlow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The salutation came from Clerk Bumford. He was standing at the
church-door on Sunday morning, looking out as if he expected me, his
face pale and stern. I had run on betimes: in fact, before the bell
began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have I done, Bumford?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you just went and left this here church open last night!
You never locked it up! When I come in but now, I found the door
right on the latch; never as much as shut!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beginning to protest till all was blue that I <em>had</em> shut and locked the
door&mdash;as I knew too well&mdash;caution pulled me up, and whispered me to
take the blame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I thought I locked it, Bumford. I never left it unlocked
before, and I&rsquo;ll take care I never leave it so again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such a thing as having the church open for a night was never
heered of,&rdquo; he grumbled, turning away to ring out the first peal of the
bell. &ldquo;Why, I might have had all my store o&rsquo; candles stole! there&rsquo;s
nigh a pound on &rsquo;em, in here. And my black gownd&mdash;and the parson&rsquo;s
gownd&mdash;and his surplice! Besides the grave-digging tools, and other
odds and ends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shutting himself into his den underneath the belfry, and tugging
away at the cords, the bell tinkled out, warning the parish that it was
time to start for morning service. The bell-ringer was a poor old man
named Japhet, who was apt to be a little late. Upon which Bumford
would begin the ringing, and blow Japhet up when he came.</p>

<p>Not a soul was yet in church. I went down the middle aisle softly
calling Fred Westerbrook&rsquo;s name. He did not answer; and I hoped
to my heart he had got clear away. The open entrance-door seemed
to indicate that he had; and I thought he might have left it undone in
case he had to make a bolt back again. Nevertheless, I could not
shake off the remembrance of my unpleasant dream.</p>

<p>Of all troublesome idiots, that Bumford was the worst. When I
went back, after passing by all the remote nooks and corners, Japhet
had taken his place at the bell, and he was telling the parson of my sins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Right on the latch all the blessed night, your reverence,&rdquo; protested
Bumford. &ldquo;We might have found the whole church ransacked this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Holland, a mild man, with stout legs, and cares of his own,
looked at me with a half-smile. &ldquo;How was it, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have assured Bumford, sir, that it shall not happen again. I
certainly thought I had locked it when I took him back the key. No
harm has come of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But harm might ha&rsquo; come,&rdquo; persisted Bumford. &ldquo;Look at all them
candles in there! and the gownds and surplices! Pretty figures we
should ha&rsquo; cut, saving his reverence&rsquo;s presence, with nothing to put
upon our backs this here blessed morning!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talking of the key, I missed mine this morning,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
Holland. &ldquo;Have you taken it away for any purpose, Bumford?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, the t&rsquo;other church-key!&rdquo; exclaimed Bumford. &ldquo;Not I, sir.
I&rsquo;d not be likely to fetch that key when I&rsquo;ve got my own&mdash;and without
your reverence&rsquo;s knowledge either!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I cannot find it anywhere,&rdquo; said Mr. Holland. &ldquo;It generally
lies on the mantelpiece at home, and it is not there this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went into the vestry with the last words. To hear that the
church-key generally lay on the mantelpiece, was nothing; for the
parson&rsquo;s house was not noticeable for order. There would have been
none in it at all but for Edna.</p>

<p>Close upon that, arrived Shepherd, a folded paper in his hand. It
contained a request that Gisby might be prayed for in the Litany.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, ain&rsquo;t he dead yet?&rdquo; asked Bumford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Shepherd. &ldquo;The doctors be afraid that internal inflammation&rsquo;s
a-setting in now. Any way, he is rare and bad, poor man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next came in my set of singers, chiefly boys and girls from the parish
school. But they sang better than such children generally sing; and
would have sung very well indeed with an organist who had his head
on his shoulders the proper way. Mrs. Todhetley had long taken pains
with them, but latterly it had all been upset by Richards&rsquo;s crotchets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; said I, gathering them before me. &ldquo;We are not
going to have any shrieking to-day. We sing to praise God, you know,
and He is in the church with you and hears you; He is not a mile or
two away, that you need shout out to be heard all that distance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, Mr. Richards tells us to sing out loud: as loud as ever
we can. Some on us a&rsquo;most cracks our voices at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind Mr. Richards to-day. I am going to play, and
I tell you to sing softly. If you don&rsquo;t, I shall stop the organ and let
you shout by yourselves. You won&rsquo;t like that. To shout and shriek
in church is more irreverent than I care to talk about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, Mr. Richards plays the organ so loud that we can&rsquo;t
help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d let Mr. Richards alone. You won&rsquo;t hear the organ
loud to-day. Do you say your prayers when you go to bed at night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This question took them aback. But at last the whole lot answered
that they did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you say your prayers softly, or do you shout them out at
the top of your voices? To my mind, it is just as unseemly to shout
when singing in church, as it would be when praying. This church
has been like nothing lately but the ranter&rsquo;s chapel. There, take your
seats, and look out the places in your Prayer-books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I watched the different groups walk into church. Our people were
pretty early. Tod slipped aside as they went up the aisle to whisper
me a question&mdash;Had Fred got clear away? I told him I thought so,
hearing and seeing nothing to the contrary. When the parson&rsquo;s
children came in, Mrs. Holland was with them, so that Edna Blake was
enabled to join the singers, as she did when she could. But it was not
often Mrs. Holland came to church. Edna had dark circles round her
eyes. They looked out at mine with a painful inquiry in their depths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think it is all right,&rdquo; I nodded in answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Holland has missed his church-key,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Coming
along to church, Charley suddenly called out that he remembered hiding
it in Mr. Fred Westerbrook&rsquo;s coat-pocket. Mrs. Holland seemed quite
put out about it, and asked me how I could possibly have allowed <em>him</em>
to come into the study and sit there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s old Westerbrook, Edna! Just look! His face is fiercer
than usual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Westerbrook was with him, in a peach-coloured corded-silk
gown. She made a point of dressing well. But she was just one of
those women that no attire, good or bad, would set off: her face
common, her figure stumpy. And so, one after another, the congregation
all came in, and the service began. It caused quite a sensation
when Mr. Holland made a pause, after turning to the Litany, and read
out the announcement: &ldquo;Your prayers are requested for Walter Gisby,
who is dangerously ill.&rdquo; Men&rsquo;s heads moved, and bonnets fluttered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I wish you played for us always, Johnny!&rdquo; cried Miss Susan
Page, looking in upon me to say it, as she passed out from her pew,
when the service was over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my playing is nothing, Miss Susan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. I don&rsquo;t know. But it has this effect, Johnny&mdash;it
sends us home with a feeling of peace in our hearts. What with
Richards&rsquo;s crashing and the singers&rsquo; shouting, we are generally turned
out in a state of irritation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After running through the voluntary, I found a large collection of
people in the churchyard. Old Westerbrook was holding forth on the
subject of Fred&rsquo;s iniquities to a numerous audience, the Squire making
one of them. Mrs. Westerbrook looked simply malicious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do <em>not</em> know where he is hiding,&rdquo; said the master of the
N.&nbsp;D. Farm in answer to a question. &ldquo;I wish I did know: I would
hang him with all the pleasure in life. An ungrateful, reckless&mdash;&mdash; What&rsquo;s
that, Squire? You&rsquo;d recommend me to increase the reward?
Why, I <em>have</em> increased it. I have doubled it. Old Jones has my
orders to post up fresh bills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If all&rsquo;s true that&rsquo;s reported, he can&rsquo;t escape very far; he had no
money in his pocket,&rdquo; put in young Mr. Stirling, of the Court, who
sometimes came over to our church. &ldquo;By the way, who has been
playing to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny Ludlow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, have you, Johnny?&rdquo; he said, turning to me. &ldquo;It was very
pleasant. And so was the singing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would have been better had Mrs. Todhetley played&mdash;as she was
to have done,&rdquo; I said, wishing they wouldn&rsquo;t bring me up before people,
and knowing that my playing was just as simple as it could be, neither
florid nor flowery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> have seen what Frederick Westerbrook was, this many a year
past,&rdquo; broke in Mrs. Westerbrook in loud tones, as if resenting the
drifting of the conversation from Fred&rsquo;s ill-doings. &ldquo;Mr. Westerbrook
knows that I have given him my opinion again and again. Only he
would not listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could I believe that my own brother&rsquo;s son was the scamp you
and Gisby made him out to be?&rdquo; testily demanded old Westerbrook,
who in his way was just as unsophisticated and straightforward as the
Squire: and would have been as good-natured, let alone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
till the last year or two Fred was as steady and dutiful as heart could
wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better say he is still,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;hang it!&mdash;I don&rsquo;t say it, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; fired old Westerbrook.
&ldquo;I should be a fool to say it. Unfortunately, I <em>can&rsquo;t</em> say it. I have
lived to find he is everything that&rsquo;s bad&mdash;and I say that hanging&rsquo;s too
good for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Holland came out of the church and passed us, halting a moment
to speak. &ldquo;I am on my way to pray by poor Gisby,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They
have sent for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gisby must need it,&rdquo; whispered Tod to me. &ldquo;He has been a
worse sinner than Fred Westerbrook: full of hatred, malice, and all
uncharitableness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so he had been&mdash;in regard to Fred.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>&ldquo;Help! Thieves!&mdash;Robbers! Help!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shouts came from our yard, as we were sitting down to breakfast
on Monday morning, and we rushed out. There stood Mack, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
the greatest state of excitement possible; his eyes lifted, his arms at
work, and his breath gone. The servants ran out before we did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! what on earth&rsquo;s the matter, Ben Mack?&rdquo; demanded the
Squire. &ldquo;Have you gone mad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had thieves in the barn, sir! Thieves! All my clothes is
stole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What clothes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Them what I left in&rsquo;t o&rsquo; Saturday night, Squire. My smock-frock
and my boots, and my spotted cotton neck-handkecher. They be gone,
they be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said the Squire, whilst I and Tod kept our faces.
&ldquo;We have not had thieves here, man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, &rsquo;deed, and the things be gone, Squire. Clean gone! Not so
much as a shred on &rsquo;em left! Please come and see for yourself,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned, and went striding across the yard. The Squire followed,
evidently at fault for comprehension; and the rest of us after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mercy as the horses and waggons bain&rsquo;t took!&rdquo; cried Mack,
plunging into the barn. &ldquo;And the harness! look at it, a-hanging up;
and that there wheelbarrer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what do you say <em>is</em> taken, Mack?&rdquo; interrupted the Squire,
cutting him short, and looking round the barn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All my traps, sir. My best smock-frock; and my boots, and my
spotted cotton neck-handkecher. A beautiful pair o&rsquo; boots, Squire,
that I generally keeps here, in case I be sent off to Alcester, or Evesham,
or where not, and have to tidy myself up a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod backed out of the barn doubled up. Nearly choking at the
&ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; boots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why do you think they are stolen, Mack?&rdquo; the Squire was
asking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I left &rsquo;em safe here o&rsquo; Saturday evening, sir, when I locked up the
barn. The things be all gone now; you may see as they be, Squire.
There bain&rsquo;t a vestige of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have any of the men moved them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas me as unlocked the barn myself but now, Squire. The key
on&rsquo;t was on the nail where I put it Saturday night. If any of the men
had unlocked it afore me this morning, they&rsquo;d not ha&rsquo; shut it up again.
We&rsquo;ve all been away at work too on t&rsquo;other side o&rsquo; the land since we
come on at six o&rsquo;clock. No, sir, it&rsquo;s thieves&mdash;and what will become of
me? A&rsquo;most a new smock-frock, and the beautifulest pair o&rsquo; strong
boots: they&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; lasted me for years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod shrieked out at last, unable to help himself. Mack cast a
reproachful glance at him, as if he thought the merriment too cruel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have been drinking on Saturday, Ben Mack, and fancied
you left &rsquo;em here,&rdquo; put in Molly, tartly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Me been a-drinking!&rdquo; retorted poor bereaved Mack, ready to cry
at the aspersion. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;d never had a drop o&rsquo; nothing inside my
lips since dinner-time, save a draught of skim milk as the dairy-maid
gave me. They was in that far corner, them boots; and the smock-frock
was laid smooth across the shaft of this here cart, the handkecher
folded a-top on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, we must inquire after the things,&rdquo; remarked the Squire,
turning to go back to breakfast. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they are stolen,
Mack: they&rsquo;ll be found somewhere. If you had lost yourself, you
could not have made more noise over it. I&rsquo;m sure I thought the ricks
must be on fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod could hardly eat his breakfast for laughing. Every now and
then he came out with the most unexpected burst. The pater
demanded what there was to laugh at in Mack&rsquo;s having mislaid his
clothes.</p>

<p>But, as the morning went on, the Squire changed his tone. When
no trace could be discovered of the articles, high or low, he took up
the opinion that we had been visited by tramps, and sent off for old
Jones the constable. Jones sent back his duty, and he would come
across as soon as he could, but he was busy organizing the search after
Master Westerbrook, and posting up the fresh bills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny, we must dispose of that hair of Fred&rsquo;s in some way,&rdquo; Tod
whispered to me in the course of the morning. &ldquo;To let any one come
upon it would never do: they might fish and ferret out everything.
Come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We went up, bolted ourselves in his room, and undid the hair. Fine,
silky hair, not quite auburn, not quite like chestnut, something between
the two, but as nice a colour as you would wish to see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better burn it,&rdquo; suggested Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it make an awful smell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who cares? You can go away if you don&rsquo;t like the smell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall save a piece for Edna Blake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rubbish, Johnny! What good will it do her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She may like to have it. Especially if she never sees him again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make haste, then, and take a lock. It&rsquo;s quite romantic. I am
going to put a match to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I chose the longest piece I could see, put it into an envelope, and
fastened it up. Tod turned the hair into his wash-hand basin, and
set it alight: the grate was filled up with the summer shavings. A
frizzling and fizzing set in at once: and very soon a rare smell of
singeing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open the window, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had hardly opened it, when the handle of the door was turned and
turned, and the panel thumped at. Hannah&rsquo;s voice came shrieking
through the keyhole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Joseph!&mdash;Master Johnny! Are you both in there? What&rsquo;s
the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What should be the matter?&rdquo; called back Tod, putting his hand
over my mouth that I should not speak. &ldquo;Go back to your nursery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something burning! My goodness! it&rsquo;s just as if all the
blankets in the house were singeing! You&rsquo;ve been setting your
blankets on fire, Mr. Joseph!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I have!&rdquo; cried Tod, blowing away at the hair to make it
burn the quicker. &ldquo;They are not yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good patience! you&rsquo;ll burn us all up, sir! Fire&mdash;fire!&rdquo; shrieked
out Hannah, frightened beyond her wits. &ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, Miss
Lena, keep away from the keyhole! Here, ma&rsquo;am! Ma&rsquo;am! Here&rsquo;s
Mr. Joseph with all his blankets on fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Todhetley ran up the stairs, and her terrified appeal came to
our ears through the door. Tod threw it open. The hair had burnt
itself out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go off for the parish engine?&rdquo; demanded Tod of
Hannah, as they came sniffing in. &ldquo;Well, where&rsquo;s the fire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dears, something must be singeing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Todhetley.
&ldquo;Where is it?&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be anything but the blankets,&rdquo; cried Hannah, choking and
stifling. &ldquo;Miss Lena, then, don&rsquo;t I tell you to keep outside, out of
harm&rsquo;s way? Well, it is strong!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Todhetley put her hand on my arm. &ldquo;Johnny, what is it?
Where is the danger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no danger at all,&rdquo; struck in Tod. &ldquo;I suppose I can burn
some old fishing-tackle rubbish in my basin if I please&mdash;horsehair, and
that. You should not have the grates filled with paper, ma&rsquo;am, if you
don&rsquo;t like the smell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went to the basin, found the smell did come from it, and then
looked at us both. I was smiling, and it reassured her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might have taken it to the kitchen and burnt it there, Joseph,&rdquo;
she said mildly. &ldquo;Indeed, I was very much alarmed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks to Hannah,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have known nothing about
it but for her. I wish you&rsquo;d just order her to mind her own business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was my business, Mr. Joseph&mdash;smelling all that frightful smell
of singeing! And if&mdash;&mdash; Why, whose boots are these?&rdquo; broke off
Hannah.</p>

<p>Opening the closet to get out the hair, we had left Fred&rsquo;s boots
exposed. Hannah&rsquo;s eyes, ranging themselves round in search of the
singeing, had espied them. She answered her own question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have brought them from school in your box by mistake.
Mr. Joseph. These are men&rsquo;s boots, these are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can take them back to school again,&rdquo; said Tod, carelessly.</p>

<p>So that passed off. &ldquo;And it is the best thing we can do with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
boots, Johnny, as I think,&rdquo; he said to me in a low tone when we were
once more left to ourselves. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t burn them. They&rsquo;d make a
choicer scent than the hair made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose they wouldn&rsquo;t fit Mack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he kept those other &lsquo;beautiful boots&rsquo; for high days and holidays,
what would he not keep these for? No, Johnny; they are too slender
for Mack&rsquo;s foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder how poor Fred likes his clumsy ones?&mdash;how he contrives
to tramp it in them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would give something to know that he was clear out of the
country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dashing over to the Parsonage under pretence of saying good-bye to
the children, I gave the envelope containing the lock of hair to Edna,
telling her what it was. The colour rushed into her face, the tears to
her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Johnny,&rdquo; she said softly. &ldquo;Yes, I shall like to keep
it&mdash;just a little memorial of him. Most likely we shall never meet
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should just take up the other side of the question, Edna, and look
forward to meeting him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not here, at any rate,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;How could he ever come
back to England with this dreadful charge hanging over him? Good
luck to you this term, Johnny Ludlow. Sometimes I think our school-days
are our happiest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were to dine in the middle of the day, and start for school at
half-past two. Tod boldly asked the Squire to give him a sovereign,
apart from any replenishing of his pockets that might take place at
starting. He wanted it for a particular purpose, he said.</p>

<p>And the pater, after holding forth a bit about thrift versus extravagance,
handed out the sovereign. Tod betook himself to the barn.
There sat Mack on the inverted wheelbarrow, at his dinner of cold
bacon and bread, and looking most disconsolate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Found the things, Mack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me found &rsquo;em, Mr. Joseph! No, sir; and I bain&rsquo;t ever likely to
find &rsquo;em, that&rsquo;s more. They are clean walked off, they are. When I
thinks o&rsquo; them there beautiful boots, and that there best smock-frock, I
be fit to choke, I be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod was fit to choke, keeping his countenance. &ldquo;What was their
value, Mack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were of untold val&rsquo;e, sir, to me. I&rsquo;d not hardly ha&rsquo; lost &rsquo;em
for a one-pound note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would a pound replace them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mack, drawing his knife across the bread and bacon, looked up.
Tod spoke more plainly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you buy new ones with a pound?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless your heart, sir, and where be I to get a pound from? I was
just a-calkelating how long it &rsquo;ud take me to save enough money up&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d answer my question, Mack. Would a pound replace
the articles that have been stolen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, in course it would, sir,&rdquo; returned Mack, staring. &ldquo;But where
be I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother. Look here: there&rsquo;s a pound&rdquo;&mdash;tossing the sovereign
to him. &ldquo;Buy yourself new ones, and think no more of the old ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mack could not believe his eyes or ears. &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Joseph! Well,
I never! Sir, you be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But now, understand this much, Mack. I only give you the money
on one condition&mdash;that you say nothing about it. <em>Tell nobody.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never, Mr. Joseph! A whole golden pound! Why, sir,
it&rsquo;ll set me up reg&rsquo;lar in&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t attend to what I am saying, Mack, I&rsquo;ll take it away
again. You are not to tell any one that you have had it, do you
hear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;ll never tell a blessed soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. I shall expect you to keep your word. Once let it be
known that your lost clothes have been replaced, and we should have
the rest of the men losing theirs on speculation. So keep a silent
tongue in your head; to the Squire as well as to others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless your heart, Mr. Joseph! I&rsquo;ll take care, sir. Nobody shan&rsquo;t
know on&rsquo;t from me. When the wife wants to ferret out where I got
&rsquo;em, I&rsquo;ll swear to her I&rsquo;ve went in trust for &rsquo;em. And I&rsquo;m sure I thank
ye, sir, with all my&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod walked away, cutting the thanks short.</p>

<p>As we were turning out at the gates on our way back to school, Tod
driving Bob and Blister (which he much liked to do, though it was not
always the Squire trusted him) and Giles sitting behind us, Duffham
was coming along on his horse. Tod pulled up, and asked what was
the latest news of Gisby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, strange to say, we are beginning to have some faint hopes of
him,&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt that at mid-day he was
a trifle easier and better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good news,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;The man is a detestable sneak,
but of course one does not want him to die. Save him if you can,
Mr. Duffham&mdash;for Fred Westerbrook&rsquo;s sake. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God-speed you both,&rdquo; returned Duffham. &ldquo;Take care of those
horses. They are fresh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod gently touched the two with the whip, and called back a saucy
word. He particularly resented any reflection on his driving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>A year went by. We were at home for the Michaelmas holidays
again. And who should chance to call at the Manor the very day of
our arrival but old Westerbrook.</p>

<p>Changes had taken place at the N.&nbsp;D. Farm. Have you ever
observed that when our whole heart is set upon a thing, our entire
aims and actions are directed to bringing it about, it is all quietly
frustrated by that Finger of Fate that none of us, whether prince or
peasant, can resist? Mrs. Westerbrook had been doing her best to
move heaven and earth to encompass the deposition of Fred Westerbrook
for her own succession, and behold she could not. Just as she
had contrived that Fred should be crushed, and she herself put into
old Westerbrook&rsquo;s will in his place, as the inheritor of the N.&nbsp;D. Farm
and all its belongings, Heaven rendered her work nugatory by taking
her to itself.</p>

<p>Yes, Mrs. Westerbrook was dead. She was carried off after a rather
short illness: and Mr. Westerbrook was a widower, bereaved and
solitary.</p>

<p>He was better off without her. The home was ten times more
peaceful. He felt <em>that</em>: but he felt it to be very lonely; and he more
than once caught himself wishing Fred was back again. Which of
course meant wishing that he had never gone away, and never turned
out to be a scamp.</p>

<p>Gisby did not die. Gisby had recovered in process of time, and was
now more active on the farm than ever. Rather too active, its master
was beginning dimly to suspect. Gisby seemed to haunt him. Gisby
assumed more power than was at all necessary; and Gisby never
ceased to pour into Mr. Westerbrook&rsquo;s ear reiterations of Fred&rsquo;s iniquity.
Altogether, Mr. Westerbrook was growing a bit tired of Gisby. He
had taken to put him down with curtness; and once when Gisby
ventured to hint that it might be a convenient arrangement if he took
up his abode in the house, Mr. Westerbrook swore at him. As to
Fred, he was still popularly looked upon as cousin-german to the fiend
incarnate.</p>

<p>Nothing had been heard of him. Nothing of any kind since that
moonlight night when he had made his escape. Waiting for news
from him so long, and waiting in vain, I, and Tod with me, had at last
made up our minds that nothing more ever would be heard of him in
this world. In short, that he had slipped out of it. Perhaps been
starved out of it. Starved to death.</p>

<p>Well, Mr. Westerbrook called at the Manor within an hour of our
getting home for Michaelmas, just twelve months after the uproar.</p>

<p>To me, he looked a good deal changed: his manner was quiet and
subdued, almost as though he no longer took much interest in life; his
hair had turned much greyer, and he complained of a continual pain
in the left leg, which made him stiff, and sometimes prevented him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
from walking. Duffham called it a touch of rheumatism. Mr. Westerbrook
fancied it might be an indication of something worse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have walked here, Westerbrook!&rdquo; remarked the Squire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And shall walk back again&mdash;round by the village,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
seems to me to be just this, Squire&mdash;that if I do not make an effort to
walk while I can, I may be laid aside for good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave a deep sigh as he spoke, as if he had the care of the whole
parish upon him. The Squire began talking of the crop of oats on the
N.&nbsp;D. Farm, saying what a famous crop it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll net a good penny by them this year, Westerbrook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Passable,&rdquo; was the indifferent reply. &ldquo;Good crops no longer bring
me the satisfaction they did, Squire. I&rsquo;ve nobody to save for now.
Will you spend a day with me before you go back, young gentlemen?&rdquo;
he went on, turning to us. &ldquo;Come on Friday. It is pretty lonely
there. It wants company to enliven it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And we promised we would go.</p>

<p>He said good-bye, and I went with him, to help him over the stile
into the lane, on account of his stiffness&mdash;for that was the road he meant
to take to Church Dykely. In passing the ricks he laid his hand on my
shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t mind a lonely day with a lonely old man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall like it, sir. We will do our best to enliven you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not much that will do that now, Johnny Ludlow,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;When a man gets to my age, and feels his health and strength failing,
it seems hard to be left all alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt it does, sir. I wish you had Fred back again!&rdquo; I boldly
added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, Johnny! Fred is lost to me for good. He made his own
bed, you know, and is lying on it. As I have to lie on mine&mdash;such as
it is. Such as he left to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know where Fred is, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I know where Fred is?&rdquo; he repeated in a tart tone. &ldquo;How
should I be likely to know? How <em>could</em> I know? I have never heard
tidings of him, good or bad, since that wretched night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had reached the stile. Old Westerbrook rested his arms upon
the top of it instead of getting over, tapping the step on the other side
with his thick walking-stick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gisby&rsquo;s opinion is that Fred threw himself into the first deep pond
that lay in his way that night, and so put an end to his career for good,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;My late wife thought so too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe anything of the kind, sir,&rdquo; said I, in hot impulse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is what Gisby is always dinning into me, Johnny. I hate to
hear him. With all Fred&rsquo;s faults, he was not one to fly to that extremity,
under&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite sure he was not, sir. And did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Under ordinary circumstances, I was about to say,&rdquo; went on the
old gentleman, with apathy, as he put one foot on the stile. &ldquo;But
when a man has the crime of murder upon his soul, there&rsquo;s no answering
for what he may be tempted to do in his remorse and terror.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not murder at all, sir. Gisby is well again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it was thought to be murder at the time. Who would have
given a brass button for Gisby&rsquo;s life that night? Don&rsquo;t quibble, Master
Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gisby was shot, sir; there&rsquo;s no denying that, or that he might have
died of it; but I am quite sure it was not Fred who shot him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tush!&rdquo; said he, testily. &ldquo;Help me over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wished I dared tell him all. Jumping across myself, I assisted him
down. Not that it would have answered any end if I did tell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I walk with you as far as the houses, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank ye, lad. I want to be independent as long as I can.
Come you both over in good time on Friday. Perhaps we can get an
hour or two&rsquo;s shooting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Friday came, and we had rather a jolly day than not, what with
shooting and feasting. Gisby drew near to join us in the cover, but
his master civilly told him that he was not wanted and need not hinder
his time in looking after us. Never a word did old Westerbrook say
that day of Fred, and he put on his best spirits to entertain us.</p>

<p>But in going away at night, when Tod had gone round to get the bag
of partridges, which old Westerbrook insisted on our taking home, he
suddenly spoke to me. We were standing at his front-door under the
starlight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made you say the other day that Fred was not guilty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because, sir, I feel sure he was not. I am as sure of it as though
Heaven had shown it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was with the gang of poachers: Gisby saw him shoot,&rdquo; said the
old man, with emphasis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gisby may have been mistaken. And Fred&rsquo;s having been with the
poachers at the moment was, I think, accidental.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why, if not guilty, did he go away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fear sent him. What would his word have been against Gisby&rsquo;s
dying declaration? You remember what a hubbub there was, sir&mdash;enough
to frighten any man away, however innocent he might be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow, for argument&rsquo;s sake, that your theory is correct, and that he
was frightened into going into hiding, why does he not come out of it?
Gisby is alive and well again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ah, I could not speak so confidently there. &ldquo;I think he must be
dead, sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s the truth. If he were not, some of us
would surely have heard of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, looking straight up at the stars.
&ldquo;We are both of the same mind, Johnny&mdash;that he is dead. I say he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
might have died that night: you think he went away first and died
afterwards. Not much difference between us, is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought there was a great deal; but I could not tell him why. &ldquo;I
wish we could hear of him, sir&mdash;and be at some certainty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I, Johnny Ludlow. He was brought up at my knee; as my
own child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On our way home, Tod with the bag of game slung over his shoulder,
we came upon Mr. Holland near the Parsonage, with Edna Blake and
the children. They had been to Farmer Page&rsquo;s harvest-home. Whilst
the parson talked to Tod, Edna snatched a moment with me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard any news, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of <em>him</em>? Never. We can&rsquo;t make it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we never shall hear,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Even if he reached
the coast in safety, he may not have got over to the other side. A
great many wrecks took place about that time: our weekly paper was
full of them. It was the time of the equinoctial gales, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along, Johnny!&rdquo; called out Tod, at this juncture. &ldquo;We
must get on. Good-night, Edna: good-night, you youngsters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day, Saturday, we went to Worcester, the Squire driving
us, and there saw Gisby as large as life. The man had naturally great
assumption of manner, and latterly he had taken to dress in the fashion.
He was looming up High Street, booted and spurred, his silver-headed
whip in his hand. Taking off his hat with an air, he wished the Squire
a loud good-morning, as if the town belonged to him, and we were only
subjects in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think Westerbrook has never been fool enough to make
his will in Gisby&rsquo;s favour!&rdquo; remarked the Squire, staring after him.
&ldquo;Egad, though, it looks like it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is to be hoped, sir, that he would make it in Fred&rsquo;s,&rdquo; was Tod&rsquo;s
rejoinder. And the suggestion put the pater out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make it in Fred&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he retorted, going into one of his heats, and
turning sharply round on the crowded pavement near the market-house,
by which he came into contact with two women and their big butter-baskets.
&ldquo;What do you mean by that, sir? Fred Westerbrook is
beyond the pale of wills, and all else. It&rsquo;s not respectable to mention
his name. He&mdash;bless the women! What on earth are these
baskets at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They seemed to be playing at bumps with the Squire; baskets thick
and threefold. Tod went in to the rescue, and got him out.</p>

<p>It was a strange thing. It really was. Considering that for the past
day or two something or other had arisen to bring up thoughts of Fred
Westerbrook, it was strange that the strangest of all things in connection
with him was yet to come.</p>

<p>Sitting round the fire after supper, upon getting home from Worcester&mdash;it
is a long drive, you know&mdash;and Tod had gone up to bed, dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
tired, who should walk in but Duffham. He would not sit down, had
no time; but told his business hastily. Dick Standish was dying, and
had something on his conscience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have heard his confession,&rdquo; said Duffham, &ldquo;as I have
heard that of many another dying man; but he seems to wish to make
it to a magistrate. Either to a magistrate, or to old Mr. Westerbrook,
he urged. But there&rsquo;s no time to go up to the N.&nbsp;D. Farm, so I came
for you, Squire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; cried the Squire, starting up in a commotion&mdash;for he
thought a great deal of his magisterial duties, and this was a very
unusual call. &ldquo;Dick Standish dying! What can he have to say?
He has been nothing but a poacher all his life, poor fellow! And what
has Westerbrook to do with him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Duffham, in his equable way, &ldquo;it strikes me that what
he wants to say may affect Fred. Perhaps Standish can clear him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clear Fred Westerbrook!&mdash;clear an iniquitous young man who
could turn poacher and murderer! What next will you say, Duffham?
Here, Johnny, get my hat and coat. Dear me! Take down a confession!
I wonder whether there&rsquo;ll be any ink there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me go with you, sir!&rdquo; I said eagerly. &ldquo;I will take my little
pocket-inkstand&mdash;and some paper&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;everything likely to be
wanted. Please let me go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, you can, Johnny. Don&rsquo;t forget a Bible. Ten to one if
<em>he</em> has one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were three brothers of these Standishes, Tom, Jim, and Dick,
none of them particularly well-doing. Tom was no better than a sort
of tramp, reappearing in the village only by fits and starts; Jim, who
had married Mary Picker, was likewise given to roving abroad, until
found and brought back by the parish; Dick, as the Squire phrased it,
was nothing but a poacher, and made his home mostly with Jim and
Mary. The cottage&mdash;a tumble-down lodgment that they did not trouble
themselves to keep in repair&mdash;was at our end of the parish half-a-mile
away, and we put our best feet foremost.</p>

<p>Dick lay upon the low bed in the loft. His illness had been very
short and sharp; it was scarcely a week yet since he was taken with it.
Duffham had done his best; but the man was dying. Jim Standish
was off on one of his roving expeditions, neither the parish nor the
public knowing whither.</p>

<p>The Squire sat by the bed, taking down the man&rsquo;s confession at a
small table, by the light of a small candle. I and Duffham stood to
hear it; Mary Standish was sent down to the kitchen. What he said
cleared Fred Westerbrook&mdash;Duffham had no doubt gathered so much
before he came for the Squire.</p>

<p>Just what Fred had told us of the events of the night, Dick Standish
confirmed now. He and other poachers were out, he said, his brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
Tom for one. They had bagged some game, and were about to
disperse when they encountered Mr. Fred Westerbrook. He stayed
talking with them, walking the same way that they did, when lo! they
all fell into the ambush planned by Gisby. A fight ensued; and he&mdash;he,
Dick Standish, now speaking, conscious that he was dying&mdash;he fired
his gun at them, and the shot entered Gisby. They ran away then and
were not pursued; a gun was fired after them, and it struck his brother
Tom, but not to hurt him very much: not enough to disable him. He
and Tom made themselves scarce at once, before daylight; and they
did not come back till danger was over, and Gisby about again. Old
Jones and other folks had come turning the cottage inside out at the
time in search of him (Dick), but his brother Jim swore through thick
and thin that Dick had not been at home for ever so long. The Squire
took all this down; and Dick signed it.</p>

<p>I was screwing the little inkstand up to return it to my pocket, when
Mr. Holland entered, Mary Standish having sent for him. Leaving
him with the sick man, we came away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny, do you know, we might almost have made sure Fred
Westerbrook was not guilty,&rdquo; said the Squire, quite humbly, as we were
crossing the turnip-field. &ldquo;But why on earth did he run away?
Where is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he must be dead, sir. What news this will be for Mr.
Westerbrook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me yes! I shall go to him with it in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the morning came&mdash;which was Sunday&mdash;the Squire was so
impatient to be off that he could hardly finish his breakfast. The
master of the N.&nbsp;D. Farm, who no longer had energy or health to keep
the old early hours, was only sitting down to his breakfast when the
Squire got there. In his well-meaning but hot way, he plunged into
the narrative so cleverly that old Westerbrook nearly had a fit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not guilty!&rdquo; he stammered, when he came to himself. &ldquo;Fred not
guilty! Only met the poachers by accident!&mdash;was not the man that
shot Gisby! Why, that&rsquo;s what Johnny Ludlow was trying to make me
believe only a day or two ago!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny was? Oh, he often sees through a stone wall. It&rsquo;s true,
anyway, Westerbrook. Fred never had a gun in his hand that night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;knowing himself innocent, why on earth does he stay
away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny thinks he must be dead,&rdquo; replied the Squire.</p>

<p>Old Westerbrook gave a groan of assent. His trembling hands upset
a cupful of coffee on the table-cloth.</p>

<p>They came on to church together arm-in-arm. Mr. Holland joined
them, and told the news&mdash;Dick Standish was dead: had died penitent.
Penitent, so far as might be, in the very short time he had given to
repentance, added the clergyman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>But knowing that Fred was innocent seemed to have renewed his
uncle&rsquo;s lease of life. He was altogether a different man. The congregation
felt quite electrified by some words read out by Mr. Holland
before the General Thanksgiving: &ldquo;Thomas Westerbrook desires to
return thanks to Almighty God for a great mercy vouchsafed to him.&rdquo;
Whispering to one another in their pews, under cover of the drooped
heads, they asked what it meant, and whether Fred could have come
home? The report of Dick Standish&rsquo;s confession had been heard
before church: and Gisby and Shepherd received some hard words for
having so positively laid the deed on Fred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I declare to goodness I thought it was Mr. Fred that fired!&rdquo; said
Shepherd, earnestly. &ldquo;Moonlight&rsquo;s deceptive, in course: but I know
he was close again&rsquo; the gun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, he was close to the gun: Dick Standish had said that much.
Mr. Fred was standing next him when he fired; Mr. Fred had tried to
put out his arm to stop him, but wasn&rsquo;t quick enough, and called him a
villain for doing it.</p>

<p>I was taking the organ again that day, if it concerns any one to know
it, and gave them the brightest chants and hymns the books contained.
The breach with Mr. Richards had never been healed, and the church
had no settled organist. Sometimes Mrs. Holland took it; sometimes
Mrs. Todhetley; once it was a stranger, who volunteered, and broke
down over the blowing; and during the holidays, if we spent them at
the Manor, it was chiefly turned over to me.</p>

<p>The Squire made old Westerbrook walk back to dine with us.
Sitting over a plate of new walnuts afterwards&mdash;there was not much
time for dessert on Sundays, before the afternoon service&mdash;Tod, calling
upon me to confirm it, told all about Fred&rsquo;s hiding in the church, and
how he had got away. But we did not say anything of the money
given him by Edna Blake: she might not have liked it. The Squire
stared with surprise, and seemed uncertain whether to praise us or to
blow us up sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up in the church for three days and nights! Nothing to eat,
except what you could crib for him! Got away at last in Mack&rsquo;s
smock-frock and boots! Well, you two are a pair of pretty conjurers,
you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless &rsquo;em both for it!&rdquo; cried old Westerbrook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they ought to have told <em>me</em>, you know, Westerbrook. I could
have managed much better&mdash;helped the poor fellow off more effectually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod gave me a kick under the table. He was nearly splitting, at
hearing the Squire say this.</p>

<p>The first thing Mr. Westerbrook did was to insert sundry advertisements
in the <cite>Times</cite> and other newspapers, about a hundred of them,
begging and imploring his dear nephew (sometimes he worded it his
&ldquo;dear boy&rdquo;) to return to him. Always underneath this advertisement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
wherever it appeared was inserted another: stating that all the particulars
of the poaching affray which took place on a certain date
(mentioning it) were known; that the poacher, Richard Standish, who
shot Walter Gisby had confessed the crime, and that Gisby had not
died of his wounds, but recovered from them. This was done with the
view of letting Fred know that he might come back with safety. But he
never came. The advertisements brought forth no answer of any kind.</p>

<p>The master of the N.&nbsp;D. Farm became very short with his bailiff as
time went on. There was no reason to suppose that Gisby had intentionally
accused Fred of the shot&mdash;he had really supposed it to come
from Fred; nevertheless, Mr. Westerbrook took a great dislike to him,
and was very short and crusty with him. Gisby did not like that, and
they had perpetual rows. When we got home for the Christmas
holidays, it was thought that Gisby would not be long on the N.&nbsp;D.
Farm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny, I want to tell you! I have had a letter. From <em>him</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The whisper came from Edna Blake. It was Christmas Eve; and
we were in the church, a lot of us, sticking the branches of holly in the
pews. The leaves had never seemed so green or the berries so red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not from Fred?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have. It came addressed to me about a week ago, with a
ten-pound Bank of England note enclosed. There was only a line or
two, just saying he had not been able to return it before, but that he
hoped he was at length getting on: and that if he did get on, he
should be sure to write again later. It was signed F.&nbsp;W. That was
all. Neither his name was mentioned, nor mine, nor any address.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did it come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;London, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From London! Nonsense, Edna!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The post-mark was London. You are welcome to see the letter.
I have brought it with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drawing the letter from her pocket under cover of her mantle, I took
it to the porch. True enough; the letter had undoubtedly been posted
in London. Calling Tod, we talked a little, and then told Edna that
we both thought she ought to disclose this to Mr. Westerbrook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I should not like to tell him myself&mdash;though
his manner to me lately has been very kind. Will you tell
him, Johnny? I will lend you the letter to show him. He will be
sure to want to see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he will have to know about the gold, Edna. The loan of that
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; it cannot be helped. I have thought it all over, and I see
that there&rsquo;s no help for its being known now. The letter alludes to it,
you perceive.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>After that the advertisements were resumed. Mr. Westerbrook put
some solicitor in London to work, and they were inserted in every
known paper. Also in some of the American and Australian papers.
Inquiries were made after Fred in London. But nothing came of it.
As to old Westerbrook, he seemed to grow better, as if the suspense
had stirred him up.</p>

<p>The months went on. Neither Fred nor news of him turned up.
That he was vegetating somewhere beyond the pale of civilization, or
else was at length really dead, appeared to be conclusive.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>July. And we boys at home again for the holidays. The first news
told us was, that Mr. Westerbrook and his bailiff had parted company.
Gisby had said farewell to the N.&nbsp;D. Farm.</p>

<p>In the satisfaction of finding himself sole master, which he had not
been for many a year, and to celebrate Gisby&rsquo;s departure, Mr. Westerbrook
gave a syllabub feast, inviting to it old and young, grown people
and children. Syllabub feasts were tolerably common with us.</p>

<p>It was an intensely hot day; the lawn was dotted with guests; most
of them gathered in groups under the trees in the shade. Old Westerbrook,
the Squire and Mrs. Todhetley, Parson and Mrs. Holland and
Mr. Brandon were together under the great horse-chestnut tree. Edna
Blake, of course, had the trouble of the parson&rsquo;s children, and I was
talking to her. Little tables with bowls of syllabub on them and cakes
and fruit stood about. By-and-by, at sunset or so, we were to go in to
a high tea.</p>

<p>It was getting on for two years since the night of Fred Westerbrook&rsquo;s
departure; and Edna was looking five times two years older. Worn
and patient were the lines of her face. She was dressed rather poorly,
as usual. She had never dressed much otherwise: but since that
unlucky night her clothes had been made to last as I should think
nobody else&rsquo;s clothes ever lasted. Whether that ten pounds had
absorbed all her funds (as it most likely had), or whether Edna had
been saving up for that visionary, possible voyage to America and the
home with Fred that was to follow it, I knew not, but one never saw
her in new things now. To-day she wore a muslin that once had had
rose-red spots on it, but repeated washings had diluted them to a pale
pink; and the pink ribbons on her hat had faded too. Not but that, in
spite of all, she looked a lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you a headache, Edna?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a little,&rdquo; she answered, putting her hand to her head.
&ldquo;Charley and Tom would race about as we came along, and I had to
run after them. To be much under a blazing sun often gives me a
headache now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wondered to myself why the parson and his wife could not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
ordered Charley and Tom to be still. Fathers and mothers never
think their children can tire people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want some more syllabub, Edna,&rdquo; cried Charley, just then.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And me too,&rdquo; put in little Miles Stirling.</p>

<p>She got up patiently; ladled some of the stuff into two of the custard-cups,
and gave one to each of the children, folding her handkerchief
under little Stirling&rsquo;s chin to guard his velvet dress. They stood at the
table, two eager little cormorants, taking it in with their tea-spoons.</p>

<p>At that moment, the gate behind us opened, and a gentleman came
in. We turned round to see who was arriving so late. A stranger.
Some good-looking fellow, with auburn hair, a beard that shone like
soft silk in the sun, and a bronzed face. To judge by his movements,
he was struck with surprise at sight of the gay company, and stood in
evident hesitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Johnny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The low, half-terrified exclamation came from Edna. I turned to
her. Her eyes were strained on the stranger; her face had turned
white as death. He saw us then, and came towards us. We were the
nearest to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know me, Edna?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I knew him then: knew his voice. Ay, and himself also, now that
I saw him distinctly. Edna did not faint; though she was white
enough for it: she only put her hands together as one does in prayer,
a joyous thankfulness dawning in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frederick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my darling. How strange that you should be the first to
greet me! And <em>you</em>, Johnny, old fellow! You <em>have</em> grown!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His two hands lay for a time in mine and Edna&rsquo;s. No one had
observed him yet: we were at the end of the lawn, well under the
trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More syllabub, Edna!&rdquo; shrieked out that greedy young Charley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And me want more, too,&rdquo; added little Miles; &ldquo;me not had enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edna drew her hand away to go to the table, a happy light shining
through her tears. Fred put his arm within mine, and we went across
the grass together.</p>

<p>The first to see him was Mr. Brandon. He took in the situation at
once, and in a degree prepared Mr. Westerbrook. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some
bronzed young man coming up, Westerbrook,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Looks like a
traveller. I should not be surprised if it is your nephew; or perhaps
one who brings news of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Old Westerbrook fell back in his chair, as Fred stood there with his
two hands stretched out to him. Then he sprang up, burst into tears,
and clasped Fred in his arms. Of all commotions! Mr. Brandon
walked away out of it into the sun, putting his yellow silk handkerchief
on his head. The Squire stared as if he had never seen a bronzed man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
before; Tod came leaping up, and the best part of the company after
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edna, Edna!&rdquo; called out Mr. Westerbrook, sitting back in his
chair again, and holding Fred tightly. &ldquo;Edna, I want you instantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She advanced modestly, blushing roses, her hat held in her hand by
its faded strings. Mr. Westerbrook looked at her through his tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here he is, my dear&mdash;do you see?&mdash;come back to us at last. We
must both welcome him. The homestead is yours from this day, Fred;
I will have only just a corner in it. I am too old now for a busy life:
you must be the acting master. And, Edna, my child, you will come
here to be his helpmeet in it, and to take care of me in my declining
years&mdash;my dear little daughter! Thank God for all things!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fred gave us just a brief summary of the past. Getting over to
America without much difficulty, he had sought there for some
remunerative work, and sought in vain. One of those panics that the
Americans go in for had recently occurred in the States, and numbers
of men were unable to get employment. After sundry adventures, and
some semi-starvation, he at length made his way to the West Indies.
A cousin of his late mother was, he knew, settled somewhere within
the regions of British Guiana. He found him in Berbice, a small
merchant of New Amsterdam. To him Fred told his whole story;
and the old cousin gave him a berth in his counting-house. Office-work
was new to Fred; but he did his best; and with the first proceeds
of his pay he enclosed the ten pounds to Edna; the house forwarding
the letter to their agents in London, to be posted there. Some
months later, he chanced to see the advertisement for him in an
English newspaper. As soon as he was able, he came off to answer it
in person; and&mdash;here he was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All&rsquo;s well that ends well,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Brandon, in his dry way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you go fraternizing with poachers again, Mr. Fred!&rdquo;
cried out the Squire. &ldquo;See what it brought you to the last time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Squire; never again,&rdquo; answered Fred, pushing back his auburn
hair (very long again), with a smile. &ldquo;This one time has been quite
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you cannot have Edna, you know,&rdquo; said Mrs. Holland to him,
with a disturbed face. &ldquo;The Parsonage could not possibly get on
without her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid the Parsonage will have to try, Mrs. Holland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be obliged to keep my bed; that will be the end of it,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Holland, gloomily. &ldquo;Nobody <em>can</em> manage the children but Edna.
When she is otherwise occupied, their noise is frightful: ten times
more distracting than the worst toothache.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fred said nothing further; she was looking so ruefully woebegone.
Putting his arm into mine, he turned into a shady walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be my groomsman at the wedding, Johnny? But for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
you, my good friend, I don&rsquo;t know that I should have been saved to
see this day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Fred, I think it was the key of the church that saved you.
I will be your groomsman if you really and truly prefer to pitch upon
me, rather than on some one older and better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are right,&rdquo; he answered, lifting his hat, and glancing
upwards. &ldquo;It was the key of the church&mdash;under God.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><span class="f9">XVII.</span><br />

SEEN IN THE MOONLIGHT.</h2>


<p>&ldquo;I tell you it is,&rdquo; repeated Tod. &ldquo;One cannot mistake Temple, even
at a distance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this man looks so much older than he. And he has whiskers.
Temple had none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And has not Temple grown older, do you suppose; and don&rsquo;t
whiskers sprout and grow? You are always a muff, Johnny. That is
Slingsby Temple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had gone by rail to Whitney Hall, and were walking up from
the station. The Squire sent us to ask after Sir John&rsquo;s gout. It was
a broiling hot day in the middle of summer. On the lawn before the
house, with some of the Whitneys, stood a stranger; a little man,
young, dark, and upright.</p>

<p>Tod was right, and I was wrong. It was Slingsby Temple. But I
thought him much altered: older-looking than his years, which
numbered close upon twenty-five, and more sedate and haughty than
ever. We had neither seen nor heard of him since quitting Oxford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s regularly in for it this time,&rdquo; said Bill Whitney, in answer
to inquiries about his father, as they shook hands with us. &ldquo;He has
hardly ever had such a bout; can only lie in bed and groan. Temple,
don&rsquo;t you remember Todhetley and Johnny Ludlow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; answered Temple, holding out his hand to me first,
and passing by Tod to do it. But that was Slingsby Temple&rsquo;s way.
I was of no account, and therefore it did not touch his pride to
notice me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you again,&rdquo; he said to Tod, cordially enough, as
he turned to him; which was quite a gracious acknowledgment for
Temple.</p>

<p>But it surprised us to see him there. The Whitneys had no
acquaintance with the Temples; neither had he and Bill been special
friends at college. Whitney explained it after luncheon, when we
were sitting outside the windows in the shade, and Temple was pacing
the shrubbery with Helen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancy it&rsquo;s a gone case,&rdquo; said Bill, nodding towards them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, William, you should not say it,&rdquo; struck in Anna, in tones of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
remonstrance, and with her pretty blush. &ldquo;It is not sure&mdash;and not
right to Mr. Temple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not say it to Tod and Johnny! Rubbish! Why, they are like
ourselves, Anna. I say I think it is going to be a case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helen with another beau!&rdquo; cried free Tod. &ldquo;How has it all come
about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mother and Helen have been staying at Malvern, you know,&rdquo;
said Whitney. &ldquo;Temple turned up at the same hotel, the Foley Arms,
and they struck up an intimacy. I went over for the last week, and
was surprised to see how thick he was with them. The mother,
who is more unsuspicious than a goose, told Temple, in her hospitable
way, when they were saying good-bye, that she should be glad to see
him if ever he found himself in these benighted parts: and I&rsquo;ll be shot
if at the end of five days he was not here! If Helen&rsquo;s not the magnet,
I don&rsquo;t know what else it can be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He appears to like her; but it may be only a temporary fancy that
will pass away; it ought not to be talked about,&rdquo; reiterated Anna. &ldquo;It
may come to nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may, or may not,&rdquo; persisted Bill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will she consent to have him?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d be simple if she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;Temple would be a
jolly fine match for any girl. Good in all ways. His property is large,
and he himself is as sober and steady as any parson. Always has been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was not thinking of Temple&rsquo;s eligibility&mdash;that was undeniable; but
of Helen&rsquo;s inclinations. Some time before she had gone in for a love
affair, which would not do at any price, caused some stir at the Hall,
and came to signal grief: though I have not time to tell of it here.
Whitney caught the drift of my thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>That&rsquo;s</em> over and done with, Johnny. She&rsquo;d never let its recollection
spoil other prospects. You may trust Helen Whitney for that. She
is as shallow-hearted as&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For shame, William!&rdquo; remonstrated Anna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say <em>you</em> were. Helen would have
twenty sweethearts to your one, and think nothing of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod looked at Anna, and laughed gently. Her cheeks turned the
colour of the rose she was holding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this about a boating tour?&rdquo; he inquired of Whitney. It
had been alluded to at lunch-time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Temple&rsquo;s going in for one with some more fellows,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;He has asked me to join them. We mean to do some of the larger
rivers; take our tent, and encamp on the bank at night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a jolly spree!&rdquo; cried Tod, his face flushing with delight.
&ldquo;How I should like it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to goodness you were coming. But Temple has made up
his party. It is his affair, you know. He talks of staying out a month.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;One get&rsquo;s no chance in this slow place,&rdquo; cried Tod, fiercely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
emigrate, I think, and go tiger-hunting. Is it a secret, this boating
affair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A secret! No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made you kick me under the table, then, when I would have
asked particulars at luncheon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because the mother was present. She has taken all sorts of queer
notions into her head&mdash;mothers always have them&mdash;that the boat will
be found bottom upwards some day, and we under it. Failing that, we
are to catch colds and fevers and agues from the night encampments.
So we say as little about it as possible before her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; nodded Tod. &ldquo;Look here, Bill, I should like to get up a
boating party myself; it sounds glorious. How do you set about it?&mdash;and
where can you get a boat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Temple knows,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. Let us go and ask him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went across the grass, leaving me alone with Anna. She and
I were the best of friends, as the reader may remember, and exchanged
many a little confidence with one another that the world knew nothing of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should you like it for Helen?&rdquo; I asked, indicating her sister and
Slingsby Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I should,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But William had no
warrant for speaking as he did. Mr. Temple will only be here a few
days longer: when he leaves, we may never see him again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he is evidently taken with Helen. He shows that he is. And
when a man of Slingsby Temple&rsquo;s disposition allows himself to betray
anything of the kind, rely upon it he means something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you like him at Oxford, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I did and did not,&rdquo; was my hesitating answer. &ldquo;He was
reserved, close, proud, and unsociable; and no man displaying those
qualities can be very much liked. On the other hand, he was exemplary
in conduct, deserving respect from all, and receiving it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think he is religious,&rdquo; said Anna, her voice taking a lower tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I always thought him that. I fancy their mother brought
them up to be so. But Temple is the last man in the world to display
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What with papa&rsquo;s taking up two rooms to himself now he has the
gout, and all of us being at home, mamma was a little at fault what
chamber to give Mr. Temple. There was no time for much arrangement,
for he came without notice; so she just turned Harry out of his
room, which used to be poor John&rsquo;s, you know, and put Mr. Temple
there. That night Harry chanced to go up to bed later than the rest
of us. He forgot his room had been changed, and went straight into
his own. Mr. Temple was kneeling down in prayer, and a Bible lay
open on the table. Mamma says it is not all young men who say their
prayers and read their Bible nowadays.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not by a good many, Anna. Yes, Temple is good, and I hope
Helen will get him. She will have position, too, as his wife, and a
large income.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He comes into his estate this year, he told us; in September. He
will be five-and-twenty then. But, Johnny, I don&rsquo;t like one thing:
William says there was a report at Oxford that the Temples never live
to be even middle-aged men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of them have died young, I believe. But, Anna, that&rsquo;s no
reason why they all should.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;there&rsquo;s a superstition attaching to the family, is there not?&rdquo;
continued Anna. &ldquo;A ghost that appears; or something of that sort?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hardly knew what to answer. How vividly the words brought back
poor Fred Temple&rsquo;s communication to me on the subject, and his subsequent
death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t speak,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell me what it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is this, Anna: but I dare say it&rsquo;s all nonsense&mdash;all fancy. When
one of the Temples is going to die, the spirit of the head of the family
who last died is said to appear and beckon to him; a warning that his
own death is near. Down in their neighbourhood people call it the
Temple superstition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand,&rdquo; cried Anna, looking earnestly at me.
&ldquo;<em>Who</em> is it that is said to appear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you an instance. When the late Mr. Temple, Slingsby&rsquo;s
father, was walking home from shooting with his gamekeeper one
September day, he thought he saw his father in the wood at a little
distance: that is, his father&rsquo;s spirit, for he had been dead some years.
It scared him very much at the moment, as the keeper testified. Well,
Anna, in a day or two he, Mr. Temple, was dead&mdash;killed by an accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad I am not a Temple; I should be always fearing I might
see the sight,&rdquo; observed Anna, a sad, thoughtful look on her gentle
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, you wouldn&rsquo;t, Anna. The Temples themselves don&rsquo;t think
of it, and don&rsquo;t believe in it. Slingsby does not, at any rate. His
brother Fred told me at Oxford that no one must presume to allude to
it in Slingsby&rsquo;s presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fred? He died at Oxford, did he not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he died there, poor fellow. Thrown from his horse. I saw it
happen, Anna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I said nothing to her of that curious scene to which I had been
a witness a night or two before the accident&mdash;when poor Fred, to
Slingsby&rsquo;s intense indignation, fancied he saw his father on the college
staircase; fancied his father beckoned to him. It was not a thing to
talk of. After that time Slingsby had seemed to regard me with rather
a special favour; I wondered whether it was because I had <em>not</em> talked
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>The afternoon passed. We went up to see Sir John in his gouty
room, and then said good-bye to them all, including Temple, and started
for home again. Tod was surly and cross. He had come out in a
temper and he was going back in one.</p>

<p>Tod liked his own way. No one in the world resented interference
more than he: and just now he and the Squire were at war. Some
twelve months before, Tod had dropped into a five-hundred-pound
legacy from a distant relative. It was now ready to be paid to him.
The Squire wished it paid over to himself, that he might take care of
it; Tod wanted to be grand, and open a banking account of his own.
For the past two days the argument had held out on both sides, and
this morning Tod had lost his temper. Lost it was again now, but on
another score.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slingsby Temple might as well have invited me to join the boating
lot!&rdquo; he broke out to me, as we drew near home. &ldquo;He knows I am
an old hand at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if his party is made up, Tod? Whitney said it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rubbish, Johnny. Made up! They could as well make room for
another. And much good some of them are, I dare say! I can&rsquo;t remember
that Slingsby ever took an oar in his hand at Oxford. All he
went in for was star-gazing&mdash;and chapels&mdash;and lectures. And look at
Bill Whitney! He hates rowing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you tell Temple you would like to join them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He could see it. I didn&rsquo;t say in so many words, Will you have
me? Of all things, I should enjoy a boating tour! It would be the
most jolly thing on earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night, after we got in, the subject of the money grievance
cropped up again. The Squire was smoking his long churchwarden
pipe at the open window; Mrs. Todhetley sat by the centre table and
the lamp, hemming a strip of muslin. Tod, open as the day on all
subjects, abused Temple&rsquo;s &ldquo;churlishness&rdquo; for not inviting him to make
one of the boating party, and declared he would organize one of his own,
which he could readily do, now he was not tied for money. That
remark set the Squire on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s just where it would be, Joe,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Let you keep
the money in your own fingers, and we should soon see what it would
end in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would it end in?&rdquo; demanded Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ducks and drakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod tossed his head. &ldquo;You think I am a child still, I believe,
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are no better, where the spending of money&rsquo;s concerned,&rdquo; said
the Squire, taking a long whiff. &ldquo;Few young men are. Their fathers
know that, and keep it from them as long as they can. And that&rsquo;s why
so many are not let come into possession of their estates before they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
are five-and-twenty. This young Temple, it seems, does not come into
his; Johnny, here, does not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to know what more harm it would do for the money
to lie in my name in the Old Bank than if it lay in yours?&rdquo; argued
Tod. &ldquo;Should I be drawing cheques on purpose to get rid of it?
That&rsquo;s what you seem to suppose, father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be drawing them to spend,&rdquo; said the pater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I shouldn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s my own money, after all. Being my own, I
should take good care of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Old Thomas came in with some glasses, and the argument dropped.
Tod began again as we were going upstairs together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Johnny,&rdquo; he said, stepping inside my room on his way,
and shutting the door for fear of eavesdroppers, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s that hundred
pounds I owe Brandon. The old fellow has been very good, never so
much as hinting that he remembers it, and I shall pay him back the
first thing. To do this, I must have absolute possession of the money.
A fine bobbery the pater would make if he got to know of it. Besides,
a man come to my age likes to have a banking account&mdash;if he can.
Good-night, lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod carried his point. He turned so restive and obstinate over it as
to surprise and vex the Squire, who of course knew nothing about the
long-standing debt to Mr. Brandon. The Squire had no legal power to
keep the money, if Tod insisted upon having it. And he did insist.
The Squire put it down to boyish folly, self-assumption; and groaned
and grumbled all the way to Worcester, when Tod was taking the five-hundred-pound
cheque, paid to him free of duty, to the Old Bank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall have youngsters in their teens wanting to open a banking
account next!&rdquo; said the pater to Mr. Isaac, as Tod was writing his
signature in the book. &ldquo;The world&rsquo;s coming to something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say young Mr. Todhetley will be prudent, and not squander
it,&rdquo; observed Mr. Isaac, with one of his pleasant smiles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, will he, though! You&rsquo;ll see. Look here,&rdquo; went on the Squire,
tapping the banker on the arm, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t you, if he draws too large a
cheque at any time, refuse to cash it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear we could not do that,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Isaac. &ldquo;So long as he
does not overdraw his account, we are bound to honour his cheques.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you do overdraw it, Joe, I hope the bank will prosecute
you!&mdash;I would, I know,&rdquo; was the Squire&rsquo;s last threat, as we left the
bank and turned towards the Cross, Tod with a cheque-book in his
pocket.</p>

<p>But Mr. Brandon could not be paid then. On going over to his
house a day or two afterwards, we found him from home. The housekeeper
thought he was on his way to one of the &ldquo;water-cure establishments&rdquo;
in Yorkshire, she said, but he had not yet written to give his
address.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So it must wait,&rdquo; remarked Tod to me, as we went home. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not sorry. How the bank would have stared at having to pay a hundred
pounds down on the nail! Conclude, no doubt, that I was going to the
deuce headlong.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; cried Tod, taking a leap in the air.</p>

<p>About a week had elapsed since the journey to the Old Bank, and
Tod was opening a letter that had come addressed to him by the
morning post.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny! will you believe it, lad? Temple asks me to be of the
boating lot, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was even so. The letter was from Slingsby Temple, written from
Templemore. It stated that he had been disappointed by some of
those who were to have made up the number, and if Todhetley and
Ludlow would supply their places, he should be glad.</p>

<p>Tod turned wild. You might have thought, as Mrs. Todhetley remarked,
that he had been invited to Eden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea of Temple&rsquo;s asking you, Johnny!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are of
no good in a boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I had better decline?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t do that, Johnny. It might upset the party altogether,
perhaps. You must do your best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no boating-suit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will treat you to one,&rdquo; said Tod, munificently. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get it at
Evesham. Pity but my things would fit you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it was, for he had loads of them.</p>

<p>The Squire, for a wonder, did not oppose the scheme. Mrs. Todhetley
(like Lady Whitney) did, in her mild way. As Bill said, all
mothers were alike&mdash;always foreseeing danger. And though she was
not Tod&rsquo;s true mother, or mine either, she was just as anxious for us;
and she looked upon it as nearly certain that one of us would come
home drowned and the other with the ague.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t sleep on the bare ground, of course,&rdquo; said Duffham,
who chanced to call that morning, while Tod was writing his letter of
acceptance to Slingsby Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we shall,&rdquo; fired Tod, resenting the remark. &ldquo;What
harm could it do us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give some of you rheumatic-fever,&rdquo; said Duffham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why doesn&rsquo;t it give it to the gipsies?&rdquo; retorted Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gipsies are used to it&mdash;born to it, as one may say. You young
men must have a waterproof sheet to lie upon, or a tarpaulin, or something
of the sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod tossed his head, disdaining an answer, and wrote on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have plenty of rugs and great-coats with you, of course,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
went on Duffham. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll give you a packet of quinine powders.
It is as well to be prepared for contingencies. If you find any symptoms
of unusual cold, or shivering, just take one or two of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Mr. Duffham,&rdquo; said Tod, dashing his pen down on the
table. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you had better attend us yourself with a
medicine-chest? Put up a cargo of rhubarb&mdash;and magnesia&mdash;and
castor oil&mdash;and family pills. A few quarts of senna-tea might not
come in amiss. My patience! I believe you take us for delicate
infants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I should recommend you to carry a small keg of whisky
amongst the boat stores,&rdquo; continued Duffham, not in the least put out.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll want it. Take a nip of it neat when you first get up from the
ground in the morning. It is necessary you should, and it will ward
off some evils that might otherwise arise. Johnny Ludlow, I&rsquo;ll put the
quinine into your charge: mind you don&rsquo;t forget it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of all the old women!&rdquo; muttered Tod to me. &ldquo;Had the pater
been in the room, this might have set him against our going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the following day we went over to Whitney Hall, intending to
take Evesham on our way back, and buy what was wanted. Surprise
the first. Bill Whitney was not at home, and was not to be of the
boating party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never saw any one in such a way in your life,&rdquo; cried Helen,
who could devote some time to us, now Temple was gone. &ldquo;I must
say it was too bad of papa. He never made any objection while Mr.
Temple was here, but let poor William anticipate all the pleasure; and
then he went and turned round afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he get afraid for him?&rdquo; cried Tod, in wonder. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
have thought it of Sir John.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afraid! no,&rdquo; returned Helen, opening her eyes. &ldquo;What he got
was a fit of the gout. A relapse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has the gout to do with Bill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, old Featherston ordered papa to Buxton, and papa said he
could not do without William to see to him there: mamma was laid up
in bed with one of her bad colds&mdash;and she is not out of it yet. So
papa went off, taking William&mdash;and you should just see how savage he
was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For William Whitney to be &ldquo;savage&rdquo; was something new. He had
about the easiest temper in the world. I laughed, and said so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Savage for him, I mean,&rdquo; corrected Helen, who was given to
talking at random. &ldquo;Nothing puts him out. Some cross fellows would
not have consented, and have told their fathers so to their faces. It is
a shame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose Bill cares much; he is no hand at rowing,&rdquo;
remarked Tod. &ldquo;Did he write to Temple and decline?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he did,&rdquo; was Helen&rsquo;s resentfully spoken answer; and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
seemed, to say the least, quite as much put out as Bill could have been.
&ldquo;What else could he do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well. I am sorry for this,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;Temple has asked me
now. Johnny also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen, her eyes sparkling. &ldquo;I hope you
will go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we shall go,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Anna?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anna? Oh, sitting up with mamma. She likes a sick-room. I
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d like a boat better&mdash;if Temple were in it,&rdquo; remarked Tod,
with a saucy laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just you be quiet,&rdquo; retorted Helen.</p>

<p>From Whitney Hall we went to Evesham, and hastily procured what
we wanted. The next day but one was that fixed for our departure,
and when it at last dawned, bright and hot, we started amidst the good
wishes of all the house. Tod with a fishing-rod and line, in case the
expedition should afford an opportunity for fishing, and I with Duffham&rsquo;s
quinine powders in my pocket.</p>

<p>Templemore, the seat of the Temples, was on the Welsh borders.
We were not going there, but to a place called Sanbury, which lay
within a few miles of the mansion. Slingsby Temple and his brother
Rupert were already there, with the boat and the tent and all the rest
of the apparatus, making ready for our departure on the morrow. Our
head-quarters, until the start, was at the Ship, a good, old-fashioned
inn, and we found that we were expected to be Temple&rsquo;s guests
there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have asked you to Templemore to dine and sleep,&rdquo; he
observed, in cordial tones, &ldquo;and my mother said she should have been
pleased to see you; but to get down here in the morning would have
been inconvenient. At least, it would take up the time that ought to
be devoted to getting away. Will you come and see the boat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was lying in a locked-up shed near the river. A tub-pair, large of
its kind. Three of them were enough for it: and I saw that, in point
of fact, I was not wanted for the working; but Temple either did not
like to ask Tod without me, or else would not leave me out. The
Temples might have more than their share of pride, but it was accompanied
by an equal share of refined and considerate feeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall make you useful, never fear,&rdquo; said he to me, with a smile.
&ldquo;And it will be capital boating experience for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I shall like it,&rdquo; I answered. And I liked him better
than I ever had in my life.</p>

<p>Numerous articles were lying ready with the boat. Temple seemed
to have thought of every needful thing. A pot to boil water in, a pan
for frying, a saucepan for potatoes, a mop and towing-rope, stone jugs
for beer, milk, and fresh water, tins to hold our grog, and the like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>Amongst the stores were tea, sugar, candles, cheese, butter, a ham,
some tinned provisions, a big jar of beer, and (Duffham should have
seen it) a two-gallon keg of whisky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A doctor up with us said we ought to have whisky,&rdquo; remarked
Tod. &ldquo;He is nothing but an old woman. He put some quinine
powders in Johnny&rsquo;s pocket, and talked of a waterproof sheet to
sleep on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; said Temple. &ldquo;There it lies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And there it did lie, wrapped round the folded tent. A large waterproof
tarpaulin to cover the ground, at night, and keep the damp from
our limbs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever make a boating tour before, Temple?&rdquo; asked Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes. I like it. I don&rsquo;t know any pleasure equal to that of
camping out at night on a huge plain, where you may study all the
stars in the heavens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Temple spoke, he glanced towards a small parcel in a corner. I
guessed it was one of his night telescopes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; he assented; &ldquo;but only a small one. The boat won&rsquo;t
stretch, and we can only load it according to its limits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rupert Temple came up as we were leaving the shed. I had never
seen him before. He was the only brother left, and Slingsby&rsquo;s heir
presumptive. Why, I know not, but I had pictured Rupert as being
like poor Fred&mdash;tall, fair, bright-looking as a man can be. But there
existed not a grain of resemblance. Rupert was just a second edition
of Slingsby: little, dark, plain, and proud. It was not an offensive
pride&mdash;quite the contrary: and with those they knew well they were
cordial and free.</p>

<p>Those originally invited by Temple were his cousin Arthur Slingsby;
Lord Cracroft&rsquo;s son; Whitney; and a young Welshman named Pryce-Hughes.
All had accepted, and intended to keep the engagement,
knowing then of nothing to prevent them. But, curious to say, each
one in succession wrote to decline it later. Whitney had to go elsewhere
with his father; Pryce-Hughes hurt his arm, which disabled him
from rowing: and Arthur Slingsby went off without ceremony in somebody&rsquo;s
yacht to Malta. As the last of the letters came, which was
Whitney&rsquo;s, Mrs. Temple seemed struck with the coincidence of all
refusing, or being compelled to refuse. &ldquo;Slingsby, my dear,&rdquo; she said
to her son, &ldquo;it looks just as though you were not to go.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I will
go,&rdquo; answered Temple, who did not like to be baulked in a project more
than anybody else likes it; &ldquo;if these can&rsquo;t come, I&rsquo;ll get others who
can.&rdquo; And he forthwith told his brother Rupert that there&rsquo;d be room
for him in the boat&mdash;he had refused him before; and wrote to Tod.
After that, came another letter from Pryce-Hughes, saying his arm was
better, and he could join the party at Bridgenorth or Bewdley. But it
was too late: the boat was filled up. Temple meant to do the Severn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
the Wye, and the Avon, with a forced interlude of canals, and to be out
a month, taking it easily, and resting on Sundays.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catch Slingsby missing Sunday service if he can help it!&rdquo; said
Rupert aside to me.</p>

<p>We started in our flannel suits and red caps, and started well, but
not until the afternoon, Temple steering, his brother and Tod taking
the sculls. The water was very shallow: and by-and-by we ran
aground. The stern of the boat swung round, and away went our
tarpaulin; and it was carried off by the current before we could save it.</p>

<p>Well, that first afternoon there were difficulties to contend with, and
one or other of the three was often in the water; but we made
altogether some five or six miles. It was the hottest day I ever felt;
and about seven o&rsquo;clock, on coming to a convenient meadow, nearly
level with the river, none of us were sorry to step ashore. Making fast
the boat for the night, we landed the tent and other things, and looked
about us. A coppice bounded the field on the left; right across, in a
second field, stood a substantial farm-house, surrounded by its barns
and ricks. Temple produced one of his cards, which was to be
taken to the house, and the farmer&rsquo;s leave asked to encamp on the
meadow. Rupert Temple and Tod made themselves decent to go on
the errand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall want a bundle or two of straw,&rdquo; said Temple; &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t
do to lie on the bare ground. And some milk. You must ask if they
will accommodate us, and pay what they charge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went off, carrying also the jar to beg for fresh water. Temple
and I began to unfurl the tent, and to busy ourselves amongst the
things generally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halloa! what&rsquo;s to do here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We turned, and saw a stout, comely man, in white shirt-sleeves, an
open waistcoat, knee-breeches and top-boots; no doubt the farmer
himself. Temple explained. He and some friends were on a boating
tour, and had landed there to encamp for the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But who gave you leave to do it?&rdquo; asked the farmer. &ldquo;You are
trespassing. This is my ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I supposed it might be necessary to ask leave,&rdquo; said Temple,
haughtily courteous; &ldquo;and I have sent to yonder house&mdash;which I
presume is yours&mdash;to solicit it. If you will kindly accord the permission,
I shall feel obliged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That Temple looked disreputable enough, there could be no denying.
No shoes on, no stockings, trousers tucked up above the knee: for he
had been several times in the water, and, as yet, had done nothing to
himself. But two of our college-caps chanced to be lying exposed on
the boat: and perhaps, Temple&rsquo;s tone and address had made their due
impression. The farmer looked hard at him, as if trying to remember
his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not one of the young Mr. Temples, is it?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Of
Templemore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Mr. Temple, of Templemore. I have sent my card to your
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dash me!&rdquo; cried the farmer, heartily. &ldquo;Shake hands, sir. I
fancied I knew the face. I&rsquo;ve seen you out shooting, sir&mdash;and at
Sanbury. I knew your father. I&rsquo;m sure you are more than welcome
to camp alongside here, and to any other accommodation I can give
you. Will you shake hands, young gentleman?&rdquo; giving his hand to
me as he released Temple&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother and another of our party are gone to your house to beg
some fresh water and buy some milk,&rdquo; said Temple, who did not seem
at all to resent the farmer&rsquo;s familiarity, but rather to like it. &ldquo;And we
shall be glad of a truss or two of fresh straw, if you can either sell it to
us or give it. We have had the misfortune to lose our waterproof
sheet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sell be hanged!&rdquo; cried the farmer, with a jovial laugh. &ldquo;Sell you
a truss or two of straw! Sell you milk! Not if I know it, Mr.
Temple. You&rsquo;re welcome, sir, to as much as ever you want of both.
One of my men shall bring the straw down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And anything else you please to think of. Don&rsquo;t scruple to ask,
sir. Will you all come and take supper at my house? We&rsquo;ve a rare
round o&rsquo; beef in cut, and I saw the missis making pigeon-pies this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Temple declined the invitation most decisively; and the farmer,
perhaps noting that, did not press it. It was rare weather for the
water, he observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could do with less heat,&rdquo; replied Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the farmer, &ldquo;I never felt it worse. But it&rsquo;s good for the
corn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, with that, he left us. The other two came back with water
and oceans of milk. Sticks were soon gathered from the coppice, and
the fire made; the round pot, filled with water, was put on to boil for
tea, and the tent was set up.</p>

<p>Often and often in my later life have I looked back to that evening.
The meal over&mdash;and a jolly good one we made&mdash;we sat round the
camp fire, then smouldering down to red embers, and watched the
setting sun, Rupert Temple and Tod smoking. It was a glorious sunset,
the west lighted up with gold and purple and crimson; the sky above
us clear and dark-blue.</p>

<p>But oh, how hot it was! The moon came up as the sun went down,
and the one, to our fancy, seemed to give out as much heat as the
other. There we sat on, sipping our grog, and talking in the bright
moonlight, Temple with his elbows on the grass, his face turned up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
towards the sky and the few stars that came out. The colours in the
west gave place to a beautiful opal, stretching northwards.</p>

<p>It was singular&mdash;I shall always think so&mdash;that the conversation
should turn on MacRae, the Scotchman who used to make our skin
creep at Oxford with his tales of second-sight. We were <em>not</em> talking of
Oxford, and I don&rsquo;t know how MacRae came up. Temple had been
talking of astronomy; from that we got to astrology; so perhaps it
was in that way. Up he came, however, he and his weird beliefs; and
Rupert Temple, who had not enjoyed the honour of Mac&rsquo;s acquaintance,
and had probably never heard his name before, got me to relate one or
two of Mac&rsquo;s choice experiences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was the man a fool?&rdquo; asked Rupert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I should say so. Making out that he could foresee
people&rsquo;s funerals before they were dead, or likely to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Fred was three-parts of a believer in them,&rdquo; put in Temple,
in a dreamy voice, as though his thoughts were buried in that past
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fred was!&rdquo; exclaimed Rupert, taking his brother up sharply.
&ldquo;Believer in what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;MacRae&rsquo;s superstitions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Slingsby!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Temple made no rejoinder. In his eye, which chanced to catch
mine at the moment, there sat a singular expression. I wondered
whether he was recalling that other superstition of Fred&rsquo;s, that little
episode a night or two before he died.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had better be turning in,&rdquo; said Temple, getting up. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
do to sit here too long; and we must be up betimes in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So we got to bed at last&mdash;if you can call it bed. The farmer&rsquo;s good
straw was strewed thickly underneath us in the tent; we had our
rugs; and the tent was fastened back at the entrance to admit air.
But there was no air to admit, not a whiff of it; nothing came in but
the moonlight. None of us remembered a lighter night, or a hotter
one. I and Tod lay in the middle, the Temples on either side, Slingsby
nearest the opening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder who&rsquo;s got our sheet?&rdquo; began Tod, breaking a silence
that ensued when we had wished each other good-night.</p>

<p>No one answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; struck in Rupert, by-and-by, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard one ought not to
go to sleep in the moonlight: it turns people luny. Do any of your
faces catch it, outside there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to sleep and don&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; said Temple.</p>

<p>It might have been from the novelty of the situation, but the night
was well on before any of us got to sleep. Tod and Rupert Temple
went off first, and next (I thought) Temple did. <em>I</em> did not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>I dare say you&rsquo;ve never slept four in a bed&mdash;and, that, one of littered
straw. It&rsquo;s all very well to lie awake when you&rsquo;ve a good wide
mattress to yourself, and can toss and turn at will; but in the close
quarters of a tent you can&rsquo;t do it for fear of disturbing the others.
However, the longest watch has its ending; and I was just dropping
off, when Temple, next to whom I lay, started hurriedly, and it
aroused me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he cried, in a half-whisper.</p>

<p>I lifted my head, startled. He was sitting up, his eyes fixed on the
opening we had left in the tent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&mdash;who is it?&rdquo; he said again; and his low voice had
a slow, queer sound, as though he spoke in fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Temple?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, standing just outside the tent, right in the moonlight,&rdquo;
whispered he. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could see nothing. The stir awoke Rupert. He called out to know
what ailed us; and that aroused Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some man looking in at us,&rdquo; explained Temple, in the same queer
tone, half of abstraction, half of fear, his gaze still strained on the
aperture. &ldquo;He is gone now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Up jumped Tod, and dashed outside the tent. Rupert struck a match
and lighted the lantern. No one was to be seen but ourselves; and the
only odd thing to be remarked was the white hue Temple&rsquo;s face had
taken. Tod was marching round the tent, looking about him far and
near, and calling out to all intruders to show themselves. But all that
met his eye was the level plain we were encamped upon, lying pale and
white under the moonlight, and all the sound he heard was the croaking
of the frogs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could have made you fancy it?&rdquo; he asked of Temple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think it was fancy,&rdquo; responded Temple. &ldquo;Never saw any
man plainer in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were dreaming, Slingsby,&rdquo; said Rupert. &ldquo;Let us get to sleep
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which we did. At least, I can answer for myself.</p>

<p>The first beams of the glorious sun awoke us, and we rose to the
beginning of another day, and to the cold, shivery feeling that, in spite
of the heat of the past night and of the coming day, attends the situation.
I could understand now why the nip of whisky, as Duffham
called it, was necessary. Tod served it out. Lighting the fire of sticks
to boil our tea-kettle&mdash;or the round pot that served for a kettle&mdash;we
began to get things in order to embark again, when breakfast should
be over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Slingsby,&rdquo; cried Rupert, to his brother, who seemed very
sullen, &ldquo;what on earth took you, that you should disturb us in the
night for nothing?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not for nothing. Some one was there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been a stray sheep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Rupert! Could one mistake a sheep for a man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some benighted ploughman then, &lsquo;plodding his weary way.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you could bring forward any ploughman to testify that it was he
beyond possibility of doubt, I&rsquo;d give him a ten-pound note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Tod, after staring a minute at this odd remark
of Temple&rsquo;s, &ldquo;you may put all idea of ploughmen and every one else
away. No one was there. If there had been, I must have seen him:
it was not possible he could betake himself out of sight in a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have it as you like,&rdquo; said Temple; &ldquo;I am going to take a bath.
My head aches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stripping, he plunged into the river, which was very wide just there,
and swam towards the middle of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to have put Slingsby out,&rdquo; observed Rupert, alluding to
the night alarm. &ldquo;Do you notice how thoughtful he is? Just look
at that fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sticks had turned black, and began to smoke and hiss, giving
out never a bit of blaze. Down knelt Rupert on one side and I on the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damp old obstinate things!&rdquo; he ejaculated. And we set on to
blow at them with all our might.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Temple?&rdquo; I exclaimed presently; looking off, and not
seeing him. Rupert glanced over the river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be diving, Johnny. Slingsby&rsquo;s fond of diving. Keep on
blowing, lad, or we shall get no tea to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So we kept on. But, I don&rsquo;t know why, a sort of doubtful feeling
came over me, and while I blew I watched the water for Temple to
come up. All in a moment he rose to the surface, gave one low, painful
cry of distress, and disappeared again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; cried Rupert, leaping up and overturning the
kettle.</p>

<p>But Tod was the quickest, and jumped in to the rescue. A first-rate
swimmer and diver was he, almost as much at home in the water as
out of it. In no time, as it seemed, he was striking back, bearing
Temple. It was fortunate for such a crisis that Temple was so small
and slight&mdash;of no weight to speak of.</p>

<p>By dint of gently rubbing and rolling, we got some life into him and
some whisky down his throat. But he remained in the queerest, faintest
state possible; no exertion in him, no movement hardly, no strength;
alive, and that was about all; and just able to tell us that he had turned
faint in the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; cried Rupert. &ldquo;We must get a doctor to
him: and he ought not to lie on the grass here. I wonder if that
farmer would let him be taken to the house for an hour or two?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>I got into my boots, and ran off to ask; and met the farmer in the
second field. He was coming towards us, curious perhaps to see
whether we had started. Telling him what had happened, he showed
himself alive with sympathy, called some of his men to carry Temple
to the farm, and sent back to prepare his wife. Their name we found
was Best: and most hospitable, good-hearted people they turned out
to be.</p>

<p>Well, Temple was taken there and a doctor was called in. The
doctor shook his head, looked grave, and asked to have another doctor.
Then, for the first time, doubts stole over us that it might be more
serious than we had thought for. A dreadful feeling of fear took
possession of me, and, in spite of all I could do, that scene at Oxford,
when poor Fred Temple had been carried into old Mrs. Golding&rsquo;s to
die, would not go out of my mind.</p>

<p>We got into our reserve clothes, as if conscious that the boating
flannels were done with for the present, left one of the farmer&rsquo;s men
to watch our boat and things, and stayed with Temple. He continued
very faint, and lay almost motionless. The doctors tried some remedies,
but they did no good. He did not revive. One of them called it
&ldquo;syncope of the heart;&rdquo; but the other said hastily, &ldquo;No, no, that was
not the right name.&rdquo; It struck me that perhaps they did not know
what the right name was. At last they said Mrs. Temple had better
be sent for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just thinking so,&rdquo; cried Rupert. &ldquo;My mother ought to be
here. Who will go for her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny can,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;He is of no good here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For that matter, none of us were any good, for we could do nothing
for Temple.</p>

<p>I did not relish the task: I did not care to tell a mother that her son,
whom she believes is well and hearty, is lying in danger. But I had
to go: Rupert seemed to take it as a matter of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t alarm her more than you can help, Ludlow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Say
that Slingsby turned faint in the water this morning, and the medical
men seem anxious. But ask her not to lose time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Best started me on his own horse&mdash;a fine hunter, iron-grey.
The weather was broiling. Templemore lay right across country, about
six miles off by road. It was a beautiful place; I could see that much,
though I had but little time to look at it; and it stood upon an eminence,
the last mile of the road winding gradually up to its gates.</p>

<p>As ill-luck had it, or perhaps good-luck&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know which&mdash;Mrs.
Temple was at one of the windows, and saw me ride hastily in.
Having a good memory of faces, she recollected mine. Knowing that
I had started with her sons in the boat, she was seized with a prevision
that something was wrong, and came out before I was well off the
horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Mr. Ludlow, I think,&rdquo; she said, her plain dark face (so much
like Slingsby&rsquo;s) very pale. &ldquo;What ill news have you brought?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told her in the best manner I was able, just in the words Rupert
had suggested, speaking quietly, and not showing any alarm in my own
manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there danger?&rdquo; she at once asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not <em>sure</em> that there is,&rdquo; I said, hardly knowing how to frame
my answer. &ldquo;The doctors thought you had better come, in case&mdash;in
case of danger arising; and Rupert sent me to ask you to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rang the bell, and ordered her carriage to be round instantly.
&ldquo;The bay horses,&rdquo; she added: &ldquo;they are the fleetest. What will you
take, Mr. Ludlow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I would not take anything. But a venerable old gentleman in
black, with a powdered bald head&mdash;the butler, I concluded&mdash;suggested
some lemonade, after my hot ride: and that I was glad of.</p>

<p>I rode on first, piloting the way for the carriage, which contained
Mrs. Temple. She came alone: her daughter was away on a visit&mdash;as
I had learnt from Rupert.</p>

<p>Slingsby lay in the same state, neither better nor worse: perhaps the
breathing was somewhat more difficult. He smiled when he saw his
mother, and put out his hand.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>The day dragged itself slowly on. We did not know what to do
with ourselves; that was a fact. Temple was to be kept quiet, and
we might not intrude into his room&mdash;one on the ground-floor that faced
the east: not even Rupert. Mr. and Mrs. Best entertained us well as
far as meals went, but one can&rsquo;t be eating for ever. Now down in the
meadow by the boat&mdash;which seemed to have assumed a most forlorn
aspect&mdash;and now hovering about the farm, waiting for the last report
of Temple. In that way the day crept through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it here that Mr. Temple is lying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was standing under the jessamine-covered porch, sheltering my
head from the rays of the setting sun, when a stranger came up and
put the question. An extraordinarily tall, thin man, with grey hair,
clerical coat, and white neckcloth.</p>

<p>It was the Reverend Mr. Webster, perpetual curate of the parish
around Templemore. And I seemed to know him before I heard his
name, for he was the very image of his son, Long Webster, who used
to be at Oxford.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so grieved not to have been able to get here before,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;but I had just gone out for some hours when Mrs. Temple&rsquo;s message
was brought to the Parsonage. Is he any better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid not,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what to make of
it; it all seems so sudden and strange.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But what is it?&rdquo; he asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. The doctors have said something about the
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to see the doctors before I go in to Mrs. Temple.
Are they here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of them is, I think. They have been going in and out all
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I fetched the doctor out to him; and they talked together in low
tones in the shaded and quiet porch. Not a ray of hope sat on the
medical man&rsquo;s face: he as good as intimated that Temple was dying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; cried the dismayed Mr. Webster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seems to know it himself,&rdquo; continued the doctor. &ldquo;At least,
we fancy so, I and my brother-practitioner. Though we have been
most cautious not to alarm him by any hint of the kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to see him,&rdquo; said the parson. &ldquo;I suppose I can?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went in, and was shut up for some time alone with Temple.
Yes, he said, when he came out again, Temple knew all about it, and
was perfectly resigned and prepared.</p>

<p>You may be sure there was no bed for any of us that night. Temple&rsquo;s
breathing grew worse; and at last we went in by turns, one of us at a
time, to prop up the pillows behind, and keep them propped; it seemed
to make it firmer and easier for him as he lay against them. Towards
morning I was called in to replace Rupert. The shaded candle seemed
to be burning dim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can lie down, my dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Temple whispered to Rupert.
&ldquo;Should there be any change, I will call you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded, and left the room. Not to lie down. Only to sit over
the kitchen fire with Tod, and so pass away the long hours of discomfort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is this now?&rdquo; panted Slingsby, as I took my place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is I. Johnny Ludlow. Do you feel any better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made a little sound of dissent in answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I think you look easier, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Temple, gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said, just opening his eyes. &ldquo;Do not grieve, mother.
I shall be better off. I shall be with my father and Fred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my son, my son, don&rsquo;t lose heart!&rdquo; she said, with a sob.
&ldquo;That will never do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw my father last night,&rdquo; said Temple.</p>

<p>The words seemed to strike her with a sort of shock. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she
exclaimed, perhaps thinking of the Temple superstition, and drawing
back a step. &ldquo;Pray, pray don&rsquo;t fancy that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tent was open to give us air,&rdquo; he said, speaking with difficulty.
&ldquo;I suddenly saw some one standing in the moonlight. I was next the
opening; and I had not been able to get to sleep. For a moment I
thought it was some man, some intruder passing by; but he took a
strange likeness to my father, and I thought he beckoned&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not alone, Slingsby,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Temple, remembering
me, her voice cold, not to say haughty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ludlow knows. He knew the last time. Fred said he saw him,
and I&mdash;I ridiculed it. Ludlow heard me. My father came for Fred,
mother; he must have come for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I can&rsquo;t believe this, Slingsby,&rdquo; she cried, in some
excitement. &ldquo;It was fancy&mdash;nervousness; nothing else. My darling,
I cannot lose you! You have ever been dearer to me than my other
children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only for a little while, mother. It is God&rsquo;s will. That is our true
home, you know; and then there will be no more parting. I am quite
happy. I seem to be half there now. What is that light?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple looked round, and saw a faint streak coming in over
the tops of the shutters. &ldquo;It must be the glimmering of dawn in the
east,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The day is breaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he answered: &ldquo;my day. Where&rsquo;s Rupert? I should like to
say good-bye to him. Yes, mother, that&rsquo;s the dawn of heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And just as the sun rose, he went there.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That was the end of our boating tour. Ridicule has been cast on
some of the facts, and will be again. It is a painful subject; and I
don&rsquo;t know that I should have related it, but for its having led to
another (and more lively) adventure, which I proceed to tell of.</p>

ROSE LODGE.</h2>


<p>It looked the prettiest place imaginable, lying under the sunlight, as
we stood that first morning in front of the bay. The water was smooth
and displayed lovely colours: now green, now blue, as the clouds
passed over the face of the sky, now taking tinges of brown and amber;
and towards evening it would be pink and purple. Further on, the
waters were rippling and shining in the sun. Fishing-vessels stood out
at sea, plying their craft; little cockle-shells, their white sails set, disported
on it; rowing boats glided hither and thither. In the distance
the grand waves of the sea were ebbing and flowing; a noble merchant-man,
all her canvas filled, was passing proudly on her outward-bound
course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to live here,&rdquo; cried Tod, turning away at last.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m sure I felt that I should. For I could watch the ever-changing
sea from morning to night and not tire of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we remain here, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, lad! For a month. I am going for a sail. Will you
come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the terrible break-up of our boating tour, poor Slingsby Temple
was taken home to Templemore, ourselves going back to Sanbury to
wait for the funeral, and for our black garments, for which we had sent.
Rupert was fearfully cut up. Although he was the heir now, and
would be chief of Templemore, I never saw any brother take a death
more to heart. &ldquo;Slingsby liked you much, Ludlow,&rdquo; said Rupert to
me, when he came to us at the inn at Sanbury the day before the
funeral, and the hot tears were in his eyes as he spoke. &ldquo;He always
liked you at Oxford: I have heard him say so. Like himself, you
kept yourself free from the lawlessness of the place&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As if a young one like Johnny would go in for anything of the
kind!&rdquo; interrupted Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young?&rdquo; repeated Rupert Temple. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. When
I was there myself, some young ones&mdash;lads&mdash;went in for a pretty good
deal. He liked you much, Ludlow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And somehow I liked to hear Rupert say it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>Quitting Sanbury after the funeral, we came to this little place, Cray
Bay, which was on the sea-coast, a few miles beyond Templemore.
Our pleasure cut short at the beginning of the holiday, we hardly knew
what to do with the rest of it, and felt like a couple of fish suddenly
thrown out of water. Mrs. Temple, taking her son and daughter, went
for change to her brother&rsquo;s, Lord Cracroft.</p>

<p>At Cray Bay we found one small inn, which bore the odd sign of the
Whistling Wind, and was kept by Mrs. Jones, a stout Welshwoman.
The bedroom she gave us enjoyed a look-out upon some stables, and
would not hold much more than the two small beds in it. In answer
to Tod&rsquo;s remonstrances, she said that she had a better room, but it was
just now occupied.</p>

<p>The discomforts of the lodging were forgotten when we strolled out
to look about us, and saw the beauties of the sea and bay. Cray Bay
was a very primitive spot: little else than a decent fishing-place. It
had not then been found out by the tour-taking world. Its houses
were built anyhow and anywhere; its shops could be counted on your
fingers: a butcher&rsquo;s, a baker&rsquo;s, a grocer&rsquo;s, and so on. Fishermen called
at the doors with fish, and countrywomen with butter and fowls.
There was no gas, and the place at night was lighted with oil-lamps.
A trout-stream lay at the back of the village, half-a-mile away.</p>

<p>Stepping into a boat, on this first morning, for the sail proposed by
Tod, we found its owner a talkative old fellow. His name was Druff,
he said; he had lived at Cray Bay most of his life, and knew every
inch of its land and every wave of its sea. There couldn&rsquo;t be a nicer
spot to stop at for the summer, as he took it; no, not if you searched
the island through: and he supposed it was first called Cray Bay after
the cray-fish, they being caught in plenty there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More things than one are called oddly in this place,&rdquo; remarked
Tod. &ldquo;Look at that inn: the Whistling Wind; what&rsquo;s that called
after?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so the wind do hoostle on this here coast; &lsquo;deed an&rsquo; it do,&rdquo;
returned Druff. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d not forget it if you heered it in winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The more we saw of Cray Bay that day, the more we liked it. Its
retirement just suited our mood, after the experience of only four or
five days back: for I can tell you that such a shock is not to be forgotten
all in a moment. And when we went up to bed that night, Tod
had made up his mind to stay for a time if lodgings could be found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in this garret, that you can&rsquo;t swing a cat in,&rdquo; said he, stretching
out his hands towards the four walls. &ldquo;Madame Jones won&rsquo;t have me
here another night if I can help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Our tent in the meadow was ten times livelier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there any lodgings to be had in this place?&rdquo; asked Tod of the
slip-shod maid-servant, when we were at breakfast the next morning.
But she professed not to know of any.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Tod, what would they say at home to our staying here?&rdquo; I
asked after awhile, certain doubts making themselves heard in my
conscience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What they chose,&rdquo; said Tod, cracking his fourth egg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid the pater&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Johnny, you need not put in your word,&rdquo; he interrupted, in
the off-hand tone that always silenced me. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your affair. We
came out for a month, and I am not going back home, like a bad
sixpence returned, before the month has expired. Perhaps I shall
tack a few weeks on to it. I am not dependent on the pater&rsquo;s purse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No; for he had his five hundred pounds lying untouched at the
Worcester Old Bank, and his cheque-book in his pocket.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, we went out to look for lodgings; but soon feared it
might be a hopeless search. Two little cottages had a handboard
stuck on a stick in the garden, with &ldquo;Lodgings&rdquo; on it. But the rooms
in each proved to be a tiny sitting-room and a more tiny bedroom,
smaller than the garret at the Whistling Wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw such a world as this,&rdquo; cried Tod, as we paced disconsolately
before the straggling dwellings in front of the bay. &ldquo;If
you want a thing you can&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might find rooms in those houses yonder,&rdquo; I said, nodding
towards some scattered about in the distance. &ldquo;They must be
farms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who wants to live a mile off?&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the place itself
I like, and the bay, and the&mdash;&mdash; Oh, by George! Look there,
Johnny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We had come to the last house in the place&mdash;a fresh-looking, charming
cottage, with a low roof and a green verandah, that we had stopped
to admire yesterday. It faced the bay, and stood by itself in a garden
that was a perfect bower of roses. The green gate bore the name
&ldquo;Rose Lodge,&rdquo; and in the parlour window appeared a notice &ldquo;To
Let;&rdquo; which notice, we both felt sure, had not been there the previous
day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fancy their having rooms to let here!&rdquo; cried Tod. &ldquo;The nicest
little house in all the place. How lucky!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In he went impulsively, striding up the short gravel-path, which was
divided from the flower-beds by two rows of sea-shells, and knocked at
the door. It was opened by a tall grenadier of a female, rising six feet,
with a spare figure and sour face. She had a large cooking-apron on,
dusted with flour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have lodgings to let,&rdquo; said Tod; &ldquo;can I see them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lodgings to let?&rdquo; she repeated, scanning us up and down attentively;
and her voice sounded harsh and rasping. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that we
have. You had better see Captain Copperas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She threw open the door of the parlour: a small, square, bright-looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
room, rather full of furniture; a gay carpet, a cottage piano,
and some green chairs being among the articles.</p>

<p>Captain Copperas came forward: a retired seaman, as we heard
later; tall as the grenadier, and with a brown, weather-beaten face.
But in voice and manners he, at any rate, did not resemble her, for they
were just as pleasant as they could be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no lodgings,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;my servant was mistaken. My
house is to let; and the furniture to be taken too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which announcement was of course a check to Tod. He sat looking
very blank, and then explained that we only required lodgings. We
had been quite charmed with Cray Bay, and would like to stay in it
for a month or so: and that it was <em>his</em> misapprehension, not the
servant&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity but you wanted a little house,&rdquo; said Captain Copperas.
&ldquo;This is the most compact, desirable, perfect little dwelling mortal
man ever was in. Rent twenty-six pounds a-year only, furniture to be
bought out-and-out for a hundred and twenty-five. It would be a little
Eden&mdash;a paradise&mdash;to those who had the means to take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke, he regarded us individually and rather pointedly. It
looked as much as to doubt whether we had the means. Tod (conscious
of his five hundred pounds in the bank) threw his head up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have the means,&rdquo; said he, as haughtily as poor Slingsby
Temple had ever spoken. &ldquo;Johnny, did you put any cards in your
pocket? Give Captain Copperas one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laid one of Tod&rsquo;s cards on the table. The captain took it up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great grief to me to leave the house,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Especially
after having been only a few months in it!&mdash;and laying in a stock
of the best furniture in a plain way, purchased in the best market!
Downright grief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why do you leave it?&rdquo; naturally asked Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I have to go afloat again,&rdquo; said the sailor, his face taking
a rueful expression. &ldquo;I thought I had given up the sea for good; but
my old employers won&rsquo;t let me give it up. They know my value as
a master, and have offered me large terms for another year or two of
service. A splendid new East Indiaman, two thousand tons register,
and&mdash;and, in short, I don&rsquo;t like to be ungrateful, so I have said
I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you not keep on the house until you come back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sister won&rsquo;t let me keep it on. Truth to say, she never cared
for the sea, and wants to get away from it. That exquisite scene&rdquo;&mdash;extending
his hand towards the bay, and to a steamer working her way
onwards near the horizon&mdash;&ldquo;has no charms for Miss Copperas; and
she intends to betake herself off to our relatives in Leeds. No: I can
only give the place up, and dispose of the furniture to whomsoever feels
inclined to take it. It will be a fine sacrifice. I shall not get the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
half of the money I gave for it: don&rsquo;t look to. And all of it as good
as new!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could read Tod&rsquo;s face as a book, and the eager look in his eyes.
He was thinking how much he should like to seize upon the tempting
bargain; to make the pretty room we sat in, and the prettier prospect
yonder, his own. Captain Copperas appeared to read him also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are doubting whether to close with the offer or not,&rdquo; he said,
with a frank smile. &ldquo;You might make it yours for a hundred and
twenty-five pounds. Perhaps&mdash;pardon me; you are both but young&mdash;you
may not have the sum readily at command?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I have,&rdquo; said Tod, candidly. &ldquo;I have it lying at my
banker&rsquo;s, in Worcester. No, it&rsquo;s not for that reason I hesitate. It is&mdash;it
is&mdash;fancy me with a house on my hands!&rdquo; he broke off, turning to
me with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an offer that you will never be likely to meet with again, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what on earth could I do with the house and the things afterwards&mdash;allowing
that we stayed here for a month or two?&rdquo; urged
Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, dispose of them again, of course,&rdquo; was the ready answer of
Captain Copperas. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d find plenty of people willing to purchase,
and to take the house off your hands. Such an opportunity as this need
not go begging. I only wish I had not to be off all in a jiffy; I should
make a very different bargain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think of it,&rdquo; said Tod, as we got up to leave. &ldquo;I must say it is
a nice little nest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the doorway we encountered a tall lady with a brown face and a
scarlet top-knot. She wore a thick gold chain, and bracelets to match.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sister, Miss Copperas,&rdquo; said the captain. And he explained to
her in a few words our business, and the purport of what had passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, don&rsquo;t lose the opportunity!&rdquo; cried she, impressively
affectionate, as though she had known us all our lives. &ldquo;So
advantageous an offer was never made to any one before: and but for
my brother&rsquo;s obstinately and wickedly deciding to go off to that wretched
sea again, it would not be made now. Yes, Alexander,&rdquo; turning to
him, &ldquo;I do call it quite wicked. Only think, sir&rdquo;&mdash;to Tod&mdash;&ldquo;a house
full of beautiful furniture, every individual thing that a family can want;
a piano here, a table-cloth press in the kitchen; plate, linen, knives,
forks; a garden full of roses and a roller for the paths; and all to go
for the miserably inadequate sum of a hundred and twenty-five pounds!
But that&rsquo;s my brother all over. He&rsquo;s a true sailor. Setting himself up
in a home to-day, and selling it off for an old song to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Fanny,&rdquo; he said, when he could get a word in edgeways
to stem the torrent of eloquence, &ldquo;I have agreed to go, and I
must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been over the house?&rdquo; she resumed, in the same voluble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
manner. &ldquo;No? Then do pray come and see it. Oh, don&rsquo;t talk of
trouble. This is the dining-room,&rdquo; throwing open a door behind her.</p>

<p>It was a little side-room, looking up the coast and over the fields;
just enough chairs and tables in it for use. Upstairs we found three
chambers, with their beds and other things. It all looked very comfortable,
and I thought Captain Copperas was foolish to ask so small a
sum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the linen closet,&rdquo; said Miss Copperas, opening a narrow
door at the top of the stairs, and displaying some shelves that seemed
to be well-filled. &ldquo;Sheets, table-cloths, dinner-napkins, towels, pillow-cases;
everything for use. Anybody, taking the house, has only to
step in, hang up his hat, and find himself at home. Look at those
plates and dishes!&rdquo; she ran on, as we got down again and entered the
kitchen. &ldquo;They are very nice&mdash;and enough to dine ten people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were of light blue ware, and looked nice enough on the dresser
shelves. The grenadier stood at the table, chopping parsley on a
trencher, and did not condescend to take any notice of us.</p>

<p>Out in the garden next, amidst the roses&mdash;which grew all round the
house, clustering everywhere. They were of that species called the
cabbage-rose: large, and fragrant, and most beautiful. It made me
think of the Roses by Bendemeer&rsquo;s stream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like the place of all things!&rdquo; cried Tod, as we strolled towards
the bay for a sail; and found Druff seated in his boat, smoking.
&ldquo;I say, Druff, do you know Captain Copperas? Get in, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lives next door to me, at Rose Lodge,&rdquo; answered Druff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Next door! What, is that low whitewashed shanty your abode?
How long has Copperas lived here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A matter of some months,&rdquo; said Druff. &ldquo;He came in the spring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they nice kind of people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They be civil to me,&rdquo; answered Druff. &ldquo;Sent my old missis a
bottle o&rsquo; wine in, and some hot broth t&rsquo; other day, when she was ill.
The captain&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sudden lurch put a stop to the discourse, and in a few minutes we
glided out of the bay, Tod sitting in a brown reverie, his gaze fixed on
the land and on Rose Lodge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mind&rsquo;s made up, Johnny. I shall take the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I dropped my knife and fork in very astonishment. Our sail over,
we were at dinner in the bar-parlour of the Whistling Wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you won&rsquo;t do it, Tod!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely I shall, lad. I never saw such a nice little nest in all my
life. And there&rsquo;s no risk; you heard what Copperas said; I shall get
my money back again when we want to leave it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Tod: I was thinking a bit whilst we sat in the boat.
Does it not seem to you to be too good to be genuine?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Tod&rsquo;s turn now to drop his knife and fork: and he did it
angrily. &ldquo;Just tell me what you mean, Johnny Ludlow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All that furniture, and the piano, and the carpets, and the plate and
linen: it looks such a heap to be going for only a hundred and twenty-five
pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think that Copperas means it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Not mean it!</em> Why, you young muff? <em>There are the things</em>, and
he has offered them to me. If Copperas chooses to part with them for
half their value, is it my place to tell him he&rsquo;s a fool? The poor man
is driven into a corner through want of time. Sailors are uncommonly
improvident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is such an undertaking, Tod.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not your undertaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it is a tremendous bargain; and it is a beautiful little
place to have. But I can&rsquo;t think what the pater will say to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;When he hears of it&mdash;but that will not be yet
awhile&mdash;he will come off here post-haste to blow me up; and end by
falling in love with the roses. He always says that there is no rose
like a cabbage-rose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will never forgive you, Tod; or me either. He will say the
world&rsquo;s coming to an end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are afraid of him, Johnny, you can take yourself off. Hold
up your plate for some more lamb, and hold your tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no help for it; anything I could say would have no more
weight with Tod than so much wasted water; so I did as he bade me,
and held my tongue. Down he went to Captain Copperas ere his
dinner was well swallowed, and told him he would take the house.
The Captain said he would have a short agreement drawn up; and
Tod took out his cheque-book, to give a cheque for the money there
and then. But the Captain, like an honest man, refused to receive it
until the agreement was executed; and, if all the same, he would
prefer money down to a cheque. Cheques were all very good, no
doubt, he said; but sailors did not much understand them. Oh, of
course, Tod answered, shaking him by the hand; he would get the
money.</p>

<p>Inquiring of our landlady for the nearest bank, Tod was directed to a
town called St. Ann&rsquo;s, three miles off; and we started for it at once,
pelting along the hot and dusty road. The bank found&mdash;a small one,
with a glazed bow-window, Tod presented a cheque for a hundred and
fifty pounds, twenty-five of it being for himself, and asked the clerk to
cash it.</p>

<p>The clerk looked at the cheque then looked at Tod, and then at me.
&ldquo;This is not one of our cheques,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have no account in
this name.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you read?&rdquo; asked Tod. &ldquo;The cheque is upon the Worcester
Old Bank. You know it well by reputation, I presume?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clerk whisked into a small kind of box, divided from the office
by glass, where sat a bald-headed gentleman writing at a desk full of
pigeon-holes. A short conference, and then the latter came to us,
holding the cheque in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will send and present this at Worcester,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and shall
get an answer the day after to-morrow. No doubt we shall then be
able to give you the money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you give it me now?&rdquo; asked Tod, in rather a fiery tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, we should be happy to do it; but it is not our custom to
cash cheques for strangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you fear the cheque will not be honoured?&rdquo; flashed Tod.
&ldquo;Why, I have five hundred pounds lying there! Do you suppose I
want to cheat you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly not,&rdquo; said the banker, with suavity. &ldquo;Only, you see,
we cannot break through our standing rules. Call upon us the day
after to-morrow, and doubtless the money will be ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod came away swearing. &ldquo;The infamous upstarts!&rdquo; cried he.
&ldquo;To refuse to cash my cheque! Johnny, it&rsquo;s my belief they take us
for a couple of adventurers.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>The money came in due course. After receiving it from the cautious
banker, we went straight to Rose Lodge, pelting back from St. Ann&rsquo;s
at a fine pace. Tod signed the agreement, and paid the cash in good
Bank of England notes. Captain Copperas brought out a bottle of
champagne, which tasted uncommonly good to our thirsty throats.
He was to leave Cray Bay that night on his way to Liverpool to take
possession of his ship; Miss Copperas would leave on the morrow, and
then we should go in. And Elizabeth, the grenadier, was to remain
with us as servant. Miss Copperas recommended her, hearing Tod say
he did not know where to look for one. We bargained with her to
keep up a good supply of pies, and to pay her twenty shillings a month.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you allow me to leave one or two of my boxes for a few
days?&rdquo; asked Miss Copperas of Tod, when we went down on the
following morning, and found her equipped for departure. &ldquo;This has
been so hurried a removal that I have not had time to pack all my
things, and must leave it for Elizabeth to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave anything you like, Miss Copperas,&rdquo; replied Tod, as he shook
hands. &ldquo;Do what you please. I&rsquo;m sure the house seems more like
yours than mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She thanked him, wished us both good-bye, and set off to walk to
the coach-office, attended by the grenadier, and a boy wheeling her
luggage. And we were in possession of our new home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span></p>

<p>It was just delightful. The weather was charming, though precious
hot, and the new feeling of being in a house of our own, with not as
much as a mouse to control us and our movements, was satisfactory in
the highest degree. We passed our days sailing about with old Druff,
and came home to the feasts prepared by the grenadier, and to sit
among the roses. Altogether we had never had a time like it. Tod
took the best chamber, facing the sea; I had the smaller one over the
dining-room, looking up coastwards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall go fishing to-morrow, Johnny,&rdquo; Tod said to me one evening.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bring home some trout for supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was stretched on three chairs before the open window; coat off,
pipe in mouth. I turned round from the piano. It was not much of
an instrument. Miss Copperas had said, when I hinted so to her on
first trying it, that it wanted &ldquo;age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall you? All right,&rdquo; I answered, sitting down by him. The
stars were shining on the calm blue water; here and there lights,
looking like stars also, twinkled from some vessels at anchor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I thought they wouldn&rsquo;t quite die of the shock, Johnny, I&rsquo;d send
the pater and madam an invitation to come off here and pay us a visit.
They would fall in love with the place at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tod, I wish you would!&rdquo; I cried, eagerly seizing on the words.
&ldquo;They could have your room, and you have mine, and I would go into
the little one at the back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say! I was only joking, lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last words and their tone destroyed my hopes. It is inconvenient
to possess a conscience. Advantageous though the bargain was that
Tod had made, and delightfully though our days were passing, I could
not feel easy until they knew of it at home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would let me write and tell them, Tod.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the pater to whirl himself off here
and spoil our peace&mdash;for that&rsquo;s what would come of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He thinks we are in some way with the Temples. His letter
implied it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best thing he can think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I want to write to the mother, Tod. She must be wondering
why we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wondering won&rsquo;t give her the fever, lad. Understand me, Mr.
Johnny: you are not to write.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Breakfast over in the morning, we crossed the meadows to the trout
stream, with the fishing-tackle and a basket of frogs. Tod complained
of the intense heat. The dark blue sky was cloudless; the sun beat
down upon our heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Johnny,&rdquo; he said, when we had borne the blaze for
an hour on the banks, the fish refusing to bite: &ldquo;we should be all the
cooler for our umbrellas. You&rsquo;ll have a sunstroke, if you don&rsquo;t look out.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It strikes me you won&rsquo;t catch any fish to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does it? You be off and get the parapluies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The low front window stood open when I reached home. It was
the readiest way of entering; and I passed on to the passage to the
umbrella-stand. The grenadier came dashing out of her kitchen,
looking frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come back for the umbrellas, Elizabeth; the sun&rsquo;s like a
furnace. Why! what have you got there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The kitchen was strewed with clothes from one end of it to the other.
On the floor stood the two boxes left by Miss Copperas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am only putting up Miss Copperas&rsquo;s things,&rdquo; returned Elizabeth,
in her surly way. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time they were sent off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a heap she must have left behind!&rdquo; I remarked, and left the
grenadier to her work.</p>

<p>We got home in the evening, tired out. The grenadier had a choice
supper ready; and, in answer to me, said the trunks of Miss Copperas
were packed and gone. When bed-time came, Tod was asleep at the
window, and wouldn&rsquo;t awake. The grenadier had gone to her room
ages ago; I wanted to go to mine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tod, then! Do please wake up: it is past ten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A low growl answered me. And in that same moment I became
aware of some mysterious stir outside the front-gate. People seemed
to be trying it. The grenadier always locked it at night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tod! Tod! There are people at the gate&mdash;trying to get in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tone and the words aroused him. &ldquo;Eh? What do you say,
Johnny? People are trying the gate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen! They are whispering to one another. They are trying
the fastenings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth does anybody want at this time of night?&rdquo; growled
Tod. &ldquo;And why can&rsquo;t they ring like decent people? What&rsquo;s your
business?&rdquo; he roared out from the window. &ldquo;Who the dickens are
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, Tod! It&mdash;it can&rsquo;t be the Squire, can it? Come down here
to look after us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The suggestion silenced him for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think so, Johnny,&rdquo; he slowly said. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not the
Squire: he would be letting off at us already at the top of his voice;
he wouldn&rsquo;t wait to come in to do it. Let&rsquo;s go and see. Come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two young men stood at the gate. One of them turned the handle
impatiently as we went down the path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; demanded Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to see Captain Copperas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you can&rsquo;t see him,&rdquo; answered Tod, woefully cross after being
startled out of his sleep. &ldquo;Captain Copperas does not live here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not live here!&rdquo; repeated the man. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s gammon. I know
he does live here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you he does not,&rdquo; haughtily repeated Tod. &ldquo;Do you doubt
my word?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who does live here, then?&rdquo; asked the man, in a different tone,
evidently impressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Todhetley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can take my oath that Captain Copperas lived here ten days ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of that? He is gone, and Mr. Todhetley&rsquo;s come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I see Mr. Todhetley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see him now. I am he. Will you tell me your business?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Copperas owes me a small account, and I want it settled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The avowal put Tod in a rage; and he showed it. &ldquo;A small
account! Is this a proper time to come bothering gentlemen for your
small accounts&mdash;when folks are gone to bed, or going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last time I came in the afternoon. Perhaps that was the wrong
time? Any way, Captain Copperas put me off, saying I was to call
some evening, and he&rsquo;d pay it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll thank you to betake yourself off again now. How dare
you disturb people at this unearthly hour! As to Captain Copperas,
I tell you that he is no longer here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I should say that Captain Copperas was a swindler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod turned on his heel at the last words, and the men went away,
their retreating footsteps echoing on the road. I thought I heard
the grenadier&rsquo;s window being shut, so the noise must have disturbed
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swindlers themselves!&rdquo; cried Tod, as he fastened the house-door.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay you a guinea, Johnny, they were two loose fellows trying to
sneak inside and see what they could pick up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in the morning he asked the grenadier whether it was
true that such men had come there after any small account. And the
grenadier resented the supposition indignantly. Captain Copperas
owed no &ldquo;small accounts&rdquo; that she knew of, she said; and she had
lived with him and Miss C. ever since they came to Cray Bay. She
only wished she had seen the men herself last night; she would have
answered them. And when, upon this, I said I thought I had heard
her shut her window down, and supposed she had been listening, she
denied it, and accused me of being fanciful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impudent wretches!&rdquo; ejaculated Tod; &ldquo;to come here and asperse
a man of honour like Copperas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That day passed off quietly, and to our thorough enjoyment; but
the next one was fated to bring us some events. Some words of Tod&rsquo;s,
as I was pouring out the breakfast coffee, startled me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, by Jupiter! How have they found us out here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking up, I saw the postman entering the gate with a letter. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
same thought struck us both&mdash;that it was some terrible mandate from
the Squire. Tod went to the window and held out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Elizabeth, at Captain Copperas&rsquo;s,&rdquo; read out the man, as he
handed it to Tod. It was a relief, and Tod sent me with it to the
grenadier.</p>

<p>But in less than one minute afterwards she came into the room,
bathed in tears. The letter was to tell her that her mother was lying
ill at their home, some unpronounceable place in Wales, and begging
earnestly to see her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to leave you at a pinch; but I must go,&rdquo; sobbed the
grenadier. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help myself; I shall start by the afternoon
coach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, of course there was nothing to be said against it. A mother
was a mother. But Tod began to wonder what on earth we should do:
as did I, for the matter of that. The grenadier offered to cook our
luncheon before starting, which we looked upon as a concession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go for a sail, Johnny, and leave perplexities to right themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And a glorious sail we had! Upon getting back at one o&rsquo;clock, we
found a huge meat pie upon the luncheon-table, and the grenadier with
her bonnet on. Tod handed her five shillings; the sum, as she computed,
that was due to her.</p>

<p>We heard the bumping of her boxes on the stairs. At the gate stood
the boy with the truck, ready to wheel them to the coach-office, as he
had wheeled those of Miss Copperas. Tod was helping himself to some
more pie, when the grenadier threw open the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My boxes are here, gentlemen. Will you like to look at them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at them for what?&rdquo; asked Tod, after staring a minute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To see that I&rsquo;m taking none of your property away inside them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last Tod understood what she meant, and felt inclined to throw
the dish at her head. &ldquo;Shut the door, and don&rsquo;t be a fool,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;And I hope you&rsquo;ll find your mother better,&rdquo; I called out after her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Johnny, what are we to do?&rdquo; cried he, when lunch was
over and there was no one to take it away. &ldquo;This is like a second
edition of Robinson Crusoe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We left it where it was, and went off to the shops and the Whistling
Wind, asking if they could tell us of a servant. But servants seemed
not to be forthcoming at a pinch; and we told our troubles to old Druff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My missis shall come in and see a bit to things for ye,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;She can light the fire in the morning, anyway, and boil the kettle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with the aid of Mother Druff&mdash;an ancient dame who went about
in clogs&mdash;we got on till after breakfast in the morning, when a damsel
came after the place. She wore a pink gauze bonnet, smart and tawdry,
and had a pert manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you cook?&rdquo; asked Tod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>The substance of her answer was, that she could do everything
under the sun, provided she were not &ldquo;tanked&rdquo; after. Her late missis
was for ever a-tanking. Would there be any washing to do?&mdash;because
washing didn&rsquo;t agree with her: and how often could she go out, and
what was the wages?</p>

<p>Tod looked at me in doubt, and I slightly shook my head. It struck
me that she would not do at any price. &ldquo;I think you won&rsquo;t suit,&rdquo; said
he to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; returned she, all impertinence. &ldquo;I can go then where I shall
suit: and so, good-morning, gentlemen. There&rsquo;s no call for you to be
so uppish. I didn&rsquo;t come after your forks and spoons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The impudent young huzzy!&rdquo; cried Tod, as she slammed the gate
after her. &ldquo;But she might do better than nobody, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like her, Tod. If it rested with me, I&rsquo;d rather live upon
bread-and-cheese than take her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bread-and-cheese!&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;It is not a question of only bread-and-cheese.
We must get our beds made and the knives cleaned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed rather a blue look-out. Tod said he would go up again to
the Whistling Wind, and tell Mother Jones she must find us some one.
Picking a rose as he went down the path, he met a cleanly-looking
elderly woman who was entering. She wore a dark apron, and old-fashioned
white cap, and said she had come after the place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo; began Tod. &ldquo;Cook?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cook and clean too, sir,&rdquo; she answered. And I liked the woman
the moment I saw her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s much cleaning to do, beyond the
knives,&rdquo; remarked Tod. &ldquo;We want our dinners cooked, you know,
and the beds made. That&rsquo;s about all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman smiled at that, as if she thought he knew little about it.
&ldquo;I have been living at the grocer&rsquo;s, up yonder, sir, and they can give
me a good character, though I say it. I&rsquo;m not afraid of doing all you
can want done, and of giving satisfaction, if you&rsquo;d please to try me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said Tod, after glancing at me. &ldquo;Can you come in at
once?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as you like, sir. When would you please to go for my
character?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother that!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt you are all right. Can
you make pigeon pies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I can, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do then. What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth Ho&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth?&rdquo; he interrupted, not giving her time to finish. &ldquo;Why,
the one just gone was Elizabeth. A grenadier, six feet high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been mostly called Betty, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll call you Betty too.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>She went away, saying that she&rsquo;d come back with her aprons. Tod
looked after her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You like her, don&rsquo;t you, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I do. She&rsquo;s a good sort; honest as can be. You did not ask
her about wages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, time enough for that,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>And Betty turned out to be good as gold. Her history was a curious
one; she told it to me one evening in the kitchen; in her small way
she had been somewhat of a martyr. But God had been with her
always, she said; through more trouble than the world knew of.</p>

<p>We had a letter from Mrs. Todhetley, redirected on from Sanbury.
The chief piece of news it contained was, that the Squire and old
Jacobson had gone off to Great Yarmouth for a fortnight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;Johnny lad, you may write home now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And tell about Rose Lodge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell all you like. I don&rsquo;t mind madam. She&rsquo;ll have leisure to
digest it against the pater returns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wrote a long letter, and told everything, going into the minute
details that she liked to hear, about the servants, and all else. Rose
Lodge was the most wonderful bargain, I said, and we were both as
happy as the days were long.</p>

<p>The church was a little primitive edifice near the sands. We went
to service on Sunday morning; and upon getting home afterwards,
found the cloth not laid. Tod had ordered dinner to be on the table.
He sent me to the kitchen to blow up Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is quite ready and waiting to be served; but I can&rsquo;t find a clean
tablecloth,&rdquo; said Betty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I told you where the tablecloths were,&rdquo; shouted Tod, who
heard the answer. &ldquo;In the cupboard at the top of the stairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there are no tablecloths there, sir,&rdquo; cried she. &ldquo;Nor anything
else either, except a towel or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod went upstairs in a passion, bidding her follow him, and flung the
cupboard door open. He thought she had looked in the wrong place.</p>

<p>But Betty was right. With the exception of two or three old towels
and some stacks of newspapers, the cupboard was empty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; cried Tod. &ldquo;Johnny, that grenadier must have walked
off with all the linen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whether she had, or had not, none to speak of could be found now.
Tod talked of sending the police after her, and wrote an account of her
delinquencies to Captain Copperas, addressing the letter to the captain&rsquo;s
brokers in Liverpool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I debated, not quite making matters out to my own satisfaction,
&ldquo;the grenadier wanted us to examine her boxes, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All for a blind, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span></p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>It was the morning following this day, Monday, that, upon looking
from my window, something struck me as being the matter with
the garden. What was it? Why, all the roses were gone! Down
I rushed, half dressed, burst out at the back-door, and gazed about
me.</p>

<p>It was a scene of desolation. The rose-trees had been stripped;
every individual rose was clipped neatly off from every tree. Two or
three trees were left untouched before the front window; all the rest
were rifled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the mischief is the matter, Johnny?&rdquo; called out Tod, as I
was hastily questioning Betty. &ldquo;You are making enough noise for ten,
lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have had robbers here, Tod. Thieves. All the roses are
stolen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made a worse noise than I did. Down he came, full rush, and
stamped about the garden like any one wild. Old Druff and his wife
heard him, and came up to the palings. Betty, busy in her kitchen,
had not noticed the disaster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see Tasker&rsquo;s people here betimes this morning,&rdquo; observed Druff.
&ldquo;A lot of &rsquo;em came. &rsquo;Twas a pity, I thought, to slice off all them nice
big blows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saw who?&mdash;saw what?&rdquo; roared Tod, turning his anger upon Druff.
&ldquo;You mean to confess to me that you saw these rose-trees rifled, and
did not stop it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, master,&rdquo; said Druff, &ldquo;how could I interfere with Tasker&rsquo;s
people? Their business ain&rsquo;t mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are Tasker&rsquo;s people?&rdquo; foamed Tod. &ldquo;Who is Tasker?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tasker? Oh, Tasker&rsquo;s that there man at the white cottage on
t&rsquo;other side the village. Got a big garden round it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he a poacher? Is he a robber?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless ye, master, Tasker&rsquo;s no robber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet you saw him take my roses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see him for certain. I see him busy with the baskets as the men
filled &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dragging me after him, Tod went striding off to Tasker&rsquo;s. We knew
the man by sight; had once spoken to him about his garden. He was
a kind of nurseryman. Tasker was standing near his greenhouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did I come and steal your roses?&rdquo; he quietly repeated, when
he could understand Tod&rsquo;s fierce demands. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t <em>steal</em> &rsquo;em, sir; I
picked &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how dared you do it? Who gave you leave to do it?&rdquo;
foamed Tod, turning green and purple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did it because they were mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yours! Are you mad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, mine. I bought &rsquo;em and paid for &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>Tod did think him mad at the moment; I could see it in his face.
&ldquo;Of whom, pray, did you buy them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of Captain Copperas. I had &rsquo;em from the garden last year and
the year afore: other folks lived in the place then. Three pounds I
gave for &rsquo;em this time. The captain sold &rsquo;em to me a month ago, and
I was to take my own time for gathering them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think Tod had ever felt so <em>floored</em> in all his life. He stood
back against the pales and stared. A month ago we had not known
Captain Copperas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might have took all the lot: &rsquo;twas in the agreement; but I left
you a few before the front winder,&rdquo; said Tasker, in an injured tone.
&ldquo;And you come and attack me like this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what do you want with them? What are they taken for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To make otter of roses,&rdquo; answered Tasker. &ldquo;I sell &rsquo;em to the
distillers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At any rate, though it be as you say, I would have taken them
openly,&rdquo; contended Tod. &ldquo;Not come like a thief in the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But then I had to get &rsquo;em afore the sun was powerful,&rdquo; calmly
answered Tasker.</p>

<p>Tod was silent all the way home. I had not spoken a word, good or
bad. Betty brought in the coffee.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pour it out,&rdquo; said he to me. &ldquo;But, Johnny,&rdquo; he presently added,
as he stirred his cup slowly round, &ldquo;I <em>can&rsquo;t</em> think how it was that
Copperas forget to tell me he had sold the roses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose he did forget?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, <em>of course</em> he forgot. Would an honest man like Copperas
conceal such a thing if he did not forget it? You will be insinuating
next, Johnny Ludlow, that he is as bad as Tasker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I must say we were rather in the dumps that day. Tod went off
fishing; I carried the basket and things. I did wish I had not said so
much about the roses to Mrs. Todhetley. What I wrote was, that they
were brighter and sweeter and better than those other roses by
Bendemeer&rsquo;s stream.</p>

<p>I thought of the affair all day long. I thought of it when I was
going to bed at night. Putting out the candle, I leaned from my
window and looked down on the desolate garden. The roses had made
its beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny! Johnny lad! Are you in bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cautious whisper came from Tod. Bringing my head inside the
room, I saw him at the door in his slippers and braces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come into my room,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Those fellows who disturbed
us the other night are at the gate again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod&rsquo;s light was out and his window open. We could see a man
bending down outside the gate, fumbling with the lock. Presently the
bell was pulled very gently, as if the ringer thought the house might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
asleep and he did not want to awaken it. There was something quite
ghostly to the imagination in being disturbed at night like this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; shouted Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; answered a cautious voice. &ldquo;I want to see Captain
Copperas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along, Johnny. This is getting complicated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We went out to the gate, and saw a man: he was not either of the
two who had come before. Tod answered him as he had answered
them, but did not open the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you a friend of the captain&rsquo;s?&rdquo; whispered the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, see here,&rdquo; resumed he, in a confidential tone. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t
get to see him it will be the worse for him. I come as a friend; come
to warn him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I tell you he is not in the house,&rdquo; argued Tod. &ldquo;He has let it
to me. He has left Cray Bay. His address? No, I cannot give it you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the man, evidently not believing a word, &ldquo;I am
come out of friendliness. If you know where he is, you just tell him
that Jobson has been here, and warns him to look out for squalls.
That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Johnny, I shall begin to fancy we are living in some mysterious
castle, if this kind of thing is to go on,&rdquo; remarked Tod, when the
man had gone. &ldquo;It seems deuced queer, altogether.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed queerer still the next morning. For a gentleman walked
in and demanded payment for the furniture. Captain Copperas had
forgotten to settle for it, he said&mdash;if he <em>had</em> gone away. Failing the
payment, he should be obliged to take away the chairs and tables.
Tod flew into a rage, and ordered him out of the place. Upon which
their tongues went in for a pitched battle, and gave out some unorthodox
words. Cooling down by-and-by, an explanation was
come to.</p>

<p>He was a member of some general furnishing firm, ten miles off.
Captain Copperas had done them the honour to furnish his house from
their stores, including the piano, paying a small portion on account.
Naturally they wanted the rest. In spite of certain strange doubts that
were arising touching Captain Copperas, Tod resolutely refused to give
any clue to his address. Finally the applicant agreed to leave matters
as they were for three or four days, and wrote a letter to be forwarded
to Copperas.</p>

<p>But the news that arrived from Liverpool staggered us more than all.
The brokers sent back Tod&rsquo;s first letter to Copperas (telling him of the
grenadier&rsquo;s having marched off with the linen), and wrote to say that
they didn&rsquo;t know any Captain Copperas; that no gentleman of that
name was in their employ, or in command of any of their ships.</p>

<p>As Tod remarked, it seemed deuced queer. People began to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
in, too, for petty accounts that appeared to be owing&mdash;a tailor, a bootmaker,
and others. Betty shed tears.</p>

<p>One evening, when we had come in from a long day&rsquo;s fishing, and
were sitting at dinner in rather a gloomy mood, wondering what was to
be the end of it, we caught sight of a man&rsquo;s coat-tails whisking up to the
front-door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit still,&rdquo; cried Tod to me, as the bell rang. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s another of those
precious creditors. Betty! don&rsquo;t you open the door. Let the fellow
cool his heels a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, instead of cooling his heels, the fellow stepped aside to our open
window, and stood there, looking in at us. I leaped out of my chair,
and nearly out of my skin. It was Mr. Brandon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what do you two fine gentlemen think of yourselves?&rdquo; began
he, when we had let him in. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t starve, at any rate, it seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take some, won&rsquo;t you, Mr. Brandon?&rdquo; said Tod politely,
putting the breast of a duck upon a plate, while I drew a chair for him
to the table.</p>

<p>Ignoring the offer, he sat down by the window, threw his yellow silk
handkerchief across his head, as a shade against the sun and the air,
and opened upon our delinquencies in his thinnest tones. In the
Squire&rsquo;s absence, Mrs. Todhetley had given him my letter to read, and
begged him to come and see after us, for she feared Tod might be
getting himself into some inextricable mess. Old Brandon&rsquo;s sarcasms
were keen. To make it worse, he had heard of the new complications,
touching Copperas and the furniture, at the Whistling Wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you must take a house and its responsibilities upon
your shoulders, and pay the money down, and make no inquiries!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We made lots of inquiries,&rdquo; struck in Tod, wincing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, did you? Then I was misinformed. You took care to
ascertain whether the landlord of the house would accept you as
tenant; whether the furniture was the man&rsquo;s own to sell, and had no
liabilities upon it; whether the rent and taxes had been paid up to
that date?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Tod had done nothing of the kind, he could only slash away at
the other duck, and bite his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You took to a closet of linen, and did not think it necessary to
examine whether linen was there, or whether it was all dumb-show&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the linen was there when we saw it,&rdquo; interrupted Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be sure; you did not handle it, or count it. The
Squire told you you would hasten to make ducks and drakes of your
five hundred pounds. It must have been burning a hole in your
pocket. As to you, Johnny Ludlow, I am utterly surprised: I did
give you credit for possessing some sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not help it, sir. I&rsquo;m sure I should never have mistrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
Captain Copperas.&rdquo; But doubts had floated in my mind whether the
linen had not gone away in those boxes of Miss Copperas, that I saw
the grenadier packing.</p>

<p>Tod pulled a letter-case out of his breast-pocket, selected a paper, and
handed it to Mr. Brandon. It was the cheque for one hundred pounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought of you, sir, before I began upon the ducks and drakes.
But you were not at home, and I could not give it you then. And I
thank you very much indeed for what you did for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Brandon read the cheque and nodded his head sagaciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it, Joseph Todhetley. If I don&rsquo;t, the money will only go
in folly.&rdquo; By which I fancied he had not meant to have the money
repaid to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are judging me rather hardly,&rdquo; said Tod. &ldquo;How was
I to imagine that the man was not on the square? When the roses
were here, the place was the prettiest place I ever saw. And it was
dirt-cheap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So was the furniture, to Copperas,&rdquo; cynically observed Mr. Brandon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is done is done,&rdquo; growled Tod. &ldquo;May I give you some
raspberry pudding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some what? Raspberry pudding! Why, I should not digest it
for a week. I want to know what you are going to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I</em> don&rsquo;t know, sir. Do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Get out of the place to-morrow. You can&rsquo;t remain in it with
bare walls: and it&rsquo;s going to be stripped, I hear. Green simpletons,
you must be! I dare say the landlord will let you off by paying him
three months&rsquo; rent. I&rsquo;ll see him myself. And you&rsquo;ll both come home
with me, like two young dogs with their tails burnt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And lose all the money I&rsquo;ve spent?&rdquo; cried Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, and think yourself well off that it is not more. You possess
no redress; as to finding Copperas, you may as well set out to search
for the philosopher&rsquo;s stone. It is nobody&rsquo;s fault but your own; and if
it shall bring you caution, it may be an experience cheaply bought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could never have believed it of a sailor,&rdquo; Tod remarked ruefully
to old Druff, when we were preparing to leave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh! fine sailor he was!&rdquo; grunted Druff. &ldquo;<em>He</em> warn&rsquo;t a sailor.
Not a reg&rsquo;lar one. Might ha&rsquo; been about the coast a bit in a collier,
perhaps&mdash;nothing more. As to that grenadier, I believe she was just
another of &rsquo;em&mdash;a sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But we heard a whiff of news later that told us Captain Copperas
was not so bad as he seemed. After he had taken Rose Lodge and
furnished it, some friend, for whom in his good-nature he had stood
surety to a large amount, let him in for the whole, and ruined him.
Honest men are driven into by-paths sometimes.</p>

<p>And so that was the inglorious finale to our charming retreat by
Bendemeer&rsquo;s stream.</p>

<h2><span class="f9">XIX.</span><br />

LEE, THE LETTER-MAN.</h2>


<p>In a side lane of Timberdale, just off the churchyard, was the cottage
of Jael Batty, whose name you have heard before. Side by side with
it stood another cottage, inhabited by Lee, the assistant letter-carrier;
or, as Timberdale generally called him, the letter-man. These cottages
had a lively look-out, the farrier&rsquo;s shop and a few thatched hayricks
opposite; sideways, the tombstones in the graveyard.</p>

<p>Some men are lucky in life, others are unlucky. Andrew Lee was
in the latter category. He had begun life as a promising farmer, but
came down in the world. First of all, he had to pay a heap of money
for some man who had persuaded him to become his security, and that
stripped him of his means. Afterwards a series of ill-fortunes set in on
the farm: crops failed, cattle died, and Lee was sold up. Since then,
he had tried at this and tried at that; been in turn a farmer&rsquo;s labourer,
an agent for coal, and the proprietor of a shop devoted to the benefit of
the younger members of the community, its speciality being bull&rsquo;s-eyes
and besoms for birch-rods. For some few years now he had settled
down in this cottage next door to Jael Batty&rsquo;s, and carried out the
letters at fourteen shillings a-week.</p>

<p>There were two letter-men, Spicer and Lee. But there need not
have been two, only that Timberdale was so straggling a parish, the
houses in it lying far and wide. Like other things in this world,
fortune, even in so trifling a matter as these two postmen, was not
dealt out equally. Spicer had the least work, for he took the home
delivery, and had the most pay; Lee did all the country tramping, and
had only the fourteen shillings. But when the place was offered to
Lee he was at a very low ebb indeed, and took it thankfully, and
thought he was set up in riches for life; for, as you well know, we
estimate things by comparison.</p>

<p>Andrew Lee was not unlucky in his fortunes only. Of his three
children, not one had prospered. The son married all too young;
within a year he and his wife were both dead, leaving a baby-boy to
Lee as a legacy. The elder daughter had emigrated to the other end of
the world with her husband; and the younger daughter had a history.
She was pretty and good and gentle, but just a goose. Goose that she
was, though, all the parish liked Mamie Lee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>About four years before the time I am telling of, there came a soldier
to Timberdale, on a visit to Spicer the letter-carrier, one James West.
He was related to Spicer&rsquo;s wife; her nephew, or cousin, or something
of that sort; a tall, good-looking, merry-tempered dragoon, with a
dashing carriage and a dashing tongue; and he ran away with the
heart of Mamie Lee. That might not so much have mattered in the
long-run, for such privilege is universally allowed to the sons of Mars;
but he also ran away with her. One fine morning Mr. James West
was missing from Timberdale, and Mamie Lee was missing also. The
parish went into a rapture of indignation over it, not so much at him as
at her; called her a &ldquo;baggage,&rdquo; and hoping her folly would come
home to her. Poor old Lee thought he had received his death-blow,
and his hair turned grey swiftly.</p>

<p>Not more than twelve months had gone by when Mamie was back
again. Jael Batty was running out one evening to get half-a-pound of
sugar at Salmon&rsquo;s shop, when she met a young woman with a bundle
staggering down the lane, and keeping under the side of the hedge as if
she were afraid of falling, or else did not want to be seen. Too weak
to carry the bundle, she seemed ready to sink at every step. Jael
Batty, who had her curiosity like other people, though she was deaf,
peered into the bent face, and brought herself up with a shriek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, is it you, Mamie Lee! Well, the impedence of this! How
on earth could you pick up the brass to come back here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are my poor father and mother alive? Do they still live here?&rdquo;
faltered Mamie, turning her piteous white face to Jael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They be both alive; but it&rsquo;s no thanks to you. If they&mdash;&mdash;
Oh, if I don&rsquo;t believe&mdash;&mdash; What have you got in that ragged old
shawl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my baby,&rdquo; answered Mamie; and she passed on.</p>

<p>Andrew Lee took her in with sobs and tears, and thanked Heaven
she had come back, and welcomed her unreasonably. The parish went
on at him for it, showering down plenty of abuse, and asking whether
he did not feel ashamed of himself. There was even a talk of his post
as letter-carrier being taken from him; but it came to nothing. Rymer
was postmaster then, though he was about giving it up; and he was a
man of too much sorrow himself to inflict it needlessly upon another.
On the contrary, he sent down cordials and tonics and things for Mamie,
who had had a fever and come home dilapidated as to strength, and
never charged for them. Thomas Rymer&rsquo;s own heart was slowly
breaking, so he could feel for her.</p>

<p>The best or the worst of it was, that Mamie said she was married.
Which assertion was of course not believed, and only added to her sin
in the eyes of Timberdale. The tale she told was this. That James
West had taken her straight to some town, where he had previously
had the banns put up, and married her there. The day after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
marriage they had sailed for Ireland, whither he had to hasten to join
his regiment, his leave of absence having expired. At the end of some
seven or eight months, the regiment was ordered to India, and he
departed with it, leaving her in her obscure lodging at Cork. By-and-by
her baby was born; she was very ill then; very; had fever and a
cough, and sundry other complications; and what with lying ill eight
weeks, and being obliged to pay a doctor and a nurse all that time,
besides other expenses, she spent all the money Mr. James West left
with her, and had no choice between starvation and coming back to
Timberdale.</p>

<p>You should have heard how this account was scoffed at. The illness,
and the baby, and the poverty nobody disputed&mdash;they were plain
enough to be seen by all Timberdale; and what better could she
expect, they would like to know? But when she came to talk about
the church (or rather, old Lee for her, second-hand, for she was not at
all a person now to be spoken to by Timberdale), then their tongues
were let loose in all kinds of inconvenient questions. <em>Which</em> was the
town?&mdash;and which was the church in it?&mdash;and where were her
&ldquo;marriage lines&rdquo;? Mamie could give no answer at all. She did not
know the name of the town, or where it was situated. James had
taken her with him in the train to it, and that was all she knew; and
she did not know the name of the church or the clergyman; and as to
marriage lines, she had never heard of any. So, as Timberdale said,
what could you make out of this, except one thing&mdash;that Mr. Jim West
had been a deep rogue, and taken her in. At best, it could have been
but a factitious ceremony; perhaps in some barn, got up like a church
for the occasion, said the more tolerant, willing to give excuse for
pretty Mamie if they could; but the chief portion of Timberdale looked
upon the whole as an out-and-out invention of her own.</p>

<p>Poor Andrew Lee had never taken a hopeful view of the affair from
the first; but he held to the more tolerant opinion that Mamie had been
herself deceived, and he could not help being cool to Spicer in consequence.
Spicer in retaliation threw all the blame upon Mamie, and
held up Mr. James West as a paragon of virtue.</p>

<p>But, as the time went on, and no news, no letter or other token arrived
from West, Mamie herself gave in. That he had deceived her she slowly
became convinced of, and despair took hold of her heart. Timberdale
might have the satisfaction of knowing that she judged herself just as
humbly and bitterly as they judged her, and was grieving herself to a
shadow. Three years had passed now since her return, and the affair
was an event of the past; and Mamie wore, metaphorically, the white
sheet of penitence, and hardly dared to show her face outside the
cottage-door.</p>

<p>But you may easily see how all this, besides the sorrow, told upon
Lee. Fourteen shillings a week for a man and his wife to exist upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
cannot be called much, especially if they have seen better days and
been used to better living. When the first grandchild, poor little
orphan, arrived to be kept, Lee and his wife both thought it hard,
though quite willing to take him; and now they had Mamie and
another grandchild. This young one was named Jemima, for Mamie
had called her after her faithless husband. Five people and fourteen
shillings a-week, and provisions dear, and house-rent to pay, and Lee&rsquo;s
shoes perpetually wanting to be mended! One or two generous
individuals grew rather fond of telling Lee that he would be better off
in the union.</p>

<p>It was November weather. A cold, dark, biting, sharp, drizzly
morning. Andrew Lee got up betimes, as usual: he had to be out
soon after seven to be ready for his letter delivery. In the kitchen
when he entered it, he found his daughter there before him, coaxing
the kettle to boil on the handful of fire, that she might make him his
cup of tea and give him his breakfast. She was growing uncommonly
weak and shadowy-looking now: a little woman, still not much more
than a girl, with a shawl folded about her shivering shoulders, a hacking
cough, and a mild, non-resisting face. Her father had lately told her
that he would not have her get up in the morning; she was not fit for
it: what he wanted done, he could do himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mamie, why are you here? You should attend to what I
say, child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She got up from her knees and turned her sad brown eyes towards
him: bright and sweet eyes once, but now dimmed with the tears and
sorrow of the last three years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am better up; I am indeed, father. Not sleeping much, I get
tired of lying: and my cough is worse in bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sat down to his cup of tea and to the bread she placed before
him. Some mornings there was a little butter, or dripping, or mayhap
bacon fat; but this morning he had to eat his bread dry. It was
getting near the end of the week, and the purse ran low. Lee had a
horror of debt, and would never let his people run into it for the
smallest sum if he knew it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s poor fare for you this morning, father; but I&rsquo;ll try and get a
morsel of boiled pork for dinner, and we&rsquo;ll have it ready early. I
expect to be paid to-day for the bit of work I have been doing for
young Mrs. Ashton. Some of those greens down by the apple-trees
want cutting: they&rsquo;ll be nice with a bit of pork.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lee turned his eyes in the direction of the greens and the apple-trees;
but the window was misty, and he could only see the drizzle of
rain-drops on the diamond panes. As he sat there, a thought came
into his head that he was beginning to feel old: old, and worn, and
shaky. Trouble ages a man more than work, more than time; and
Lee never looked at the wan face of his daughter, and at its marks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
sad repentance, but he felt anew the sting which was always pricking
him more or less. What with that, and his difficulty to keep the
pot boiling, and his general state of shakiness, Lee was older than his
years. Timberdale had fallen into the habit of calling him Old Lee,
you see; but he was not sixty yet. He had a nice face; when it was a
young face it must have been like Mamie&rsquo;s. It had furrows in it now,
and his scanty grey locks hung down on each side of it.</p>

<p>Putting on his top-coat, which was about as thin as those remarkable
sheets told of by Brian O&rsquo;Linn, Lee went out buttoning it. The rain
had ceased, but the cold wind took him as he went down the narrow
garden-path, and he could not help shivering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bitter wind to-day, father; in the north-east, I think,&rdquo; said
Mamie, standing at the door to close it after him. &ldquo;I hope there&rsquo;ll be
no letters for Crabb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lee, as he pressed along in the teeth of the cruel east wind, was
hoping the same. Salmon the grocer, who had taken the post-office, as
may be remembered, when the late Thomas Rymer gave it up, was
sorting the letters in the room behind the shop when Lee went in.
Spicer, a lithe, active, dark-eyed man of forty-five, stood at the end of
the table waiting for his bag. Lee went and stood beside him, giving
him a brief good-morning: he had not taken kindly to the man since
West ran away with Mamie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A light load this morning,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Salmon to Spicer, as he
handed him his appropriate bag. &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s yours, Lee,&rdquo; he added
a minute after: &ldquo;not heavy either. Too cold for people to write, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything for Crabb, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Crabb? Well, yes, I think there is. For the Rector.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon going out, Spicer turned one way, Lee the other. Spicer&rsquo;s
district was easy as play; Lee&rsquo;s was a regular country tramp, the farm-houses
lying in all the four points of the compass. The longest tramp
was over to us at Crabb. And why the two houses, our own and
Coney&rsquo;s farm, should continue to be comprised in the Timberdale
delivery, instead of that of Crabb, people could never understand.
It was so still, however, and nobody bestirred himself to alter it. For
one thing, we were not often at Crabb Cot, and the Coneys did not have
many letters, so it was not like an every-day delivery: we chanced to
be there just now.</p>

<p>The letter spoken of by Salmon, which would bring Lee to Crabb
this morning, was for the Reverend Herbert Tanerton, Rector of
Timberdale. He and his wife, who was a niece of old Coney&rsquo;s, were
now staying at the farm on a week&rsquo;s visit, and he had given orders to
Salmon that his letters, during that week, were to be delivered at the
farm instead of at the Rectory.</p>

<p>Lee finally got through his work, all but this one letter for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
parson, and turned his steps our way. As ill-luck had it&mdash;the poor
fellow thought it so afterwards&mdash;he could not take the short and
sheltered way through Crabb Ravine, for he had letters that morning
to Sir Robert Tenby, at Bellwood, and also for the Stone House on the
way to it. By the time he turned on the solitary road that led to
Crabb, Lee was nearly blown to smithereens by the fierce north-east
wind, and chilled to the marrow. All his bones ached; he felt low,
frozen, ill, and wondered whether he should get over the ground
without breaking down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I might have a whiff at my pipe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A pipe is to many people the panacea for all earthly discomfort; it
was so to Lee. But only in the previous February had occurred that
damage to Helen Whitney&rsquo;s letter, when she was staying with us,
which the authorities had made much of; and Lee was afraid to risk a
similar mishap again. He carried Salmon&rsquo;s general orders with him:
not to smoke during his round. Once the letters were delivered, he
might do so.</p>

<p>His weak grey hair blowing about, his thin and shrunken frame
shivering and shaking as the blasts took him, his empty post-bag thrust
into his pocket, and the Rector of Timberdale&rsquo;s letter in his hand, Lee
toiled along on his weary way. To a strong man the walk would have
been nothing, and not much to Lee in fairer weather. It was the cold
and wind that tired him. And though, after giving vent to the above
wish, he held out a little while, presently he could resist the comfort no
longer, but drew forth his pipe and struck a match to light it.</p>

<p>How it occurred he never knew, never knew to his dying day, but
the flame from the match caught the letter, and set it alight. It was
that thin foreign paper that catches so quickly, and the match was
obstinate, and the wind blew the flame about. He pressed the fire out
with his hands, but a portion of the letter was burnt.</p>

<p>If Timbuctoo, or some other far-away place had been within the
distance of a man&rsquo;s legs, Lee would have made straight off for it. His
pipe on the ground, the burnt letter underneath his horrified gaze, and
his hair raised on end, stood he. What on earth should he do? It
had been only a pleasant young lady&rsquo;s letter last time, and only a little
scorched; now it was the stern Rector&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>There was but one thing he could do&mdash;go on with the letter to its
destination. It often happens in these distressing catastrophes that the
one only course open is the least palatable. His pipe hidden away in
his pocket&mdash;for Lee had had enough of it for that morning&mdash;and the
damaged letter humbly held out in his hand, Lee made his approach to
the farm.</p>

<p>I chanced to be standing at its door with Tom Coney and Tod.
Those two were going out shooting, and the Squire had sent me running
across the road with a message to them. Lee came up, and, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
face that seemed greyer than usual, and a voice from which most of its
sound had departed, he told his tale.</p>

<p>Tom Coney gave a whistle. &ldquo;Oh, by George, Lee, won&rsquo;t you catch
it! The Rector&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Rector&rsquo;s a regular martinet, you know,&rdquo; Tom Coney was
about to add, but he was stopped by the appearance of the Rector
himself.</p>

<p>Herbert Tanerton had chanced to be in the little oak-panelled hall,
and caught the drift of the tale. A frown sat on his cold face as he
came forward, a frown that would have befitted an old face better than
a young one.</p>

<p>He was not loud. He did not fly into a passion as Helen Whitney
did. He just took the unfortunate letter in his hand, and looked at it,
and looked at Lee, and spoke quietly and coldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is, I believe, the second time you have burnt the letters?&rdquo;
and Lee dared not deny it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in direct defiance of orders. You are not allowed to smoke
when on your rounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never attempt to smoke again, when on my round, as long as I
live, sir, if you&rsquo;ll only be pleased to look over it this time,&rdquo; gasped Lee,
holding up his hands in a piteous way. But the Rector was one who
went in for &ldquo;duty,&rdquo; and the appeal found no favour with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it would be to encourage wrong-doing, Lee. Meet
me at eleven o&rsquo;clock at Salmon&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never again, sir, so long as I live!&rdquo; pleaded Lee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you
my word of that, sir; and I never broke it yet. Oh, sir, if you will but
have pity upon me and not report me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At eleven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; repeated Herbert Tanerton decisively, as he
turned indoors again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What an old stupid you must be!&rdquo; cried Tod to Lee. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t
excuse you; he&rsquo;s the wrong sort of parson to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a pretty kettle of fish you&rsquo;ve made of it,&rdquo; added Tom Coney.
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded much, had it been my letter; but he is
different, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Lee turned his eyes on me: perhaps remembering that he had
asked me, the other time, to stand his friend with Miss Whitney. No
one could be his friend now: when the Rector took up a grievance he
did not let it drop again; especially if it were his own. Good-hearted
Jack, his sailor-brother, would have screened Lee, though all the
letters in the parish had got burnt.</p>

<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock precisely the Reverend Herbert Tanerton entered
Salmon&rsquo;s shop; and poor Lee, not daring to disobey his mandate, crept
in after him. They had it out in the room behind. Salmon was
properly severe; told Lee he was not sure but the offence involved penal
servitude, and that he deserved hanging. A prosperous tradesman in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
his small orbit, the man was naturally inclined to be dictatorial, and
was ambitious of standing well with his betters, especially the Rector.
Lee was suspended there and then; and Spicer was informed that for
a time, until other arrangements were made, he must do double duty.
Spicer, vexed at this, for it would take him so much the more time
from his legitimate business, that of horse doctor, told Lee he was a
fool, and deserved not only hanging but drawing and quartering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; asked Ben Rymer, crossing the road from his own
shop to accost Lee, as the latter came out of Salmon&rsquo;s. Ben was the
chemist now&mdash;had been since Margaret&rsquo;s marriage&mdash;and was steady;
and Ben, it was said, would soon pass his examination for surgeon. He
had his hands in his pockets and his white apron on, for Mr. Ben
Rymer had no false pride, and would as soon show himself to Timberdale
in an apron as in a dress-coat.</p>

<p>Lee told his tale, confessing the sin of the morning. Mr. Rymer
nodded his head significantly several times as he heard it, and pushed his
red hair from his capacious forehead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t look over it this time, Lee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could but get some one to be my friend with the Rector, and
ask him to forgive me,&rdquo; said Lee. &ldquo;Had your father been alive, Mr.
Rymer, I think he would have done it for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely. No good to ask me&mdash;if that&rsquo;s what you are hinting
at. The Rector looks upon me as a black sheep, and turns on me the
cold shoulder. But I don&rsquo;t think he is one to listen, Lee, though the
king came to ask him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I shall do I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; bewailed Lee. &ldquo;If the place is
stopped, the pay stops, and I&rsquo;ve not another shilling in the world, or
the means of earning one. My wife&rsquo;s ailing, and Mamie gets worse
day by day; and there are the two little ones. They are all upon
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some people here say, Lee, that you should have sent Mamie and
her young one to the workhouse, and not have charged yourself with
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, sir, several have told me that. But people don&rsquo;t know what
a father&rsquo;s feelings are till they experience them. Mary was my own
child that I had dandled on my knee, and watched grow up in her
pretty ways, and I was fonder of her than of any earthly thing. The
workhouse might not have taken her in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has forfeited all claim on you. And come home only to break
your heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; meekly assented Lee. &ldquo;But the Lord has told us we are
to forgive, not seven times, but seventy times seven. If I had turned
her adrift from my door and heart, sir, who knows but I might have
been turned adrift myself at the Last Day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Evidently it was of no use talking to one so unreasonable as Lee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
And Mr. Ben Rymer went back to his shop. A customer was entering
it with a prescription and a medicine-bottle.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>One morning close upon Christmas, Mrs. Todhetley despatched me
to Timberdale through the snow for a box of those delectable &ldquo;Household
Pills,&rdquo; which have been mentioned before: an invention of the late
Mr. Rymer&rsquo;s, and continued to be made up by Ben. Ben was behind
the counter as usual when I entered, and shook the snow off my boots
on the door-mat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; he asked me presently, wrapping up the box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to-day. There goes old Lee! How thin he looks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Starvation,&rdquo; said Ben, craning his long neck to look between the
coloured globes at Lee on the other side the way. &ldquo;Lee has nothing
coming in now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do they all live upon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness knows. Upon things that he pledges, and the vegetables
in the garden. I was in there last night, and I can tell you it was a
picture, Mr. Johnny Ludlow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A picture of what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Misery: distress: hopelessness. It is several weeks now since Lee
earned anything, and they have been all that time upon short commons.
Some days on no commons at all, I expect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what took you there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard such an account of the girl&mdash;Mamie&mdash;yesterday afternoon,
of her cough and her weakness, that I thought I&rsquo;d see if any of my
drugs would do her good. But it&rsquo;s food they all want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mamie very ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very ill indeed. I&rsquo;m not sure but she&rsquo;s dying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a dreadful thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One can&rsquo;t ask too many professional questions&mdash;people are down
upon you for that before you have passed,&rdquo; resumed Ben, alluding to
his not being qualified. &ldquo;But I sent her in a cordial or two, and I
spoke to Darbyshire; so perhaps he will look in upon her to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben Rymer might have been a black sheep once upon a time, but he
had not a bad heart. I began wondering whether Mrs. Todhetley could
help them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Mamie Lee still able to do any sewing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About as much as I could do it. Not she. I shall hear what
Darbyshire&rsquo;s report is. They would certainly be better off in the
workhouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish they could be helped!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much chance of that,&rdquo; said Ben. &ldquo;She is a sinner, and he is
a sinner: that&rsquo;s what Timberdale says, you know. People in these
enlightened days are so very self-righteous!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How is Lee a sinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How! Why, has he not burnt up the people&rsquo;s letters? Mr.
Tanerton leads the van in banning him, and Timberdale follows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went home, questioning whether our folk would do anything to
help the Lees. No one went on against ill-doings worse than the
Squire; and no one was more ready than he to lend a helping hand
when the ill-doers were fainting for want of it.</p>

<p>It chanced that just about the time I was talking to Ben Rymer, Mr.
Darbyshire, the doctor at Timberdale, called at Lee&rsquo;s. He was a little,
dark man, with an irritable temper and a turned-up nose, but good as
gold at heart. Mamie Lee lay back in a chair, her head on a pillow,
weak and wan and weary, the tears slowly rolling down her cheeks.
Darbyshire was feeling her pulse, and old Mrs. Lee pottered about,
bringing sticks from the garden to feed the handful of fire. The two
children sat on the brick floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it were not for leaving my poor little one, I should be glad to
die, sir,&rdquo; she was saying. &ldquo;I shall be glad to go; hope it is not wrong
to say it. She and I have been a dreadful charge upon them here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darbyshire looked round the kitchen. It was almost bare; the
things had gone to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s. Then he looked at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for you to die yet. Don&rsquo;t get that fallacy in your
head. You&rsquo;ll come round fast enough with a little care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I&rsquo;m afraid not; I think I am past it. It has all come of
the trouble, sir; and perhaps, when I&rsquo;m gone, the neighbours will
judge me more charitably. I believed with all my heart it was a true
marriage&mdash;and I hope you&rsquo;ll believe me when I say it, sir; it never
came into my mind to imagine otherwise. And I&rsquo;d have thought the
whole world would have deceived me sooner than James.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; says Darbyshire, &ldquo;most girls think that. Well, I&rsquo;ll send you
in some physic to soothe the pain in the chest. But what you most
want, you see, is kitchen physic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Rymer has been very good in sending me cordials and cough-mixture,
sir. Mother&rsquo;s cough is bad, and he sent some to her as well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. Mrs. Lee, I am telling your daughter that what she most
wants is kitchen physic. Good kitchen physic, you understand.
You&rsquo;d be none the worse yourself for some of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dame Lee, coming in just then in her pattens, tried to put her poor
bent back as upright as she could, and shook her head before answering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kitchen physic don&rsquo;t come in our way now, Dr. Darbyshire. We
just manage not to starve quite, and that&rsquo;s all. Perhaps, sir, things
may take a turn. The Lord is over all, and He sees our need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He dave me some pep&rsquo;mint d&rsquo;ops,&rdquo; said the little one, who had
been waiting to put in a word. &ldquo;Andy, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who did?&rdquo; asked the doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. &rsquo;Ymer.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span></p>

<p>Darbyshire patted the little straw-coloured head, and went out. An
additional offence in the eyes of Timberdale was that the child&rsquo;s fair
curls were just the pattern of those on the head of James the deceiver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, have you seen Mamie Lee?&rdquo; asked Ben Rymer, who
chanced to be standing at his shop-door after his dinner, when Darbyshire
was passing by from paying his round of visits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have seen her. There&rsquo;s no radical disease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think her uncommonly ill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Darbyshire nodded. &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s not too far gone to be cured. She&rsquo;d
get well fast enough under favourable circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning good food?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meaning food and other things. Peace of mind, for instance. She
is just fretting herself to death. Shame, remorse, and all that, have
taken hold of her; besides grieving her heart out after the fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her voice is so hollow! Did you notice it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hollow from weakness only. As to her being too far gone, she is
not so at present; at least, that&rsquo;s my opinion; but how soon she may
become so I can&rsquo;t say. With good kitchen physic, as I&rsquo;ve just told
them, and ease of mind to help me, I&rsquo;ll answer for it that I&rsquo;d have her
well in a month; but the girl has neither the one nor the other. She
seems to look upon coming death in the light of a relief, rather than
otherwise; a relief to her own mental trouble, and a relief to the household,
in the shape of saving it what she eats and drinks. In such a
condition as this, you must be aware that the mind does not help the
body by striving for existence; it makes no effort to struggle back to
health; and there&rsquo;s where Mamie Lee will fail. Circumstances are
killing her, not disease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you try her lungs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Partially. I&rsquo;m sure I am right. The girl will probably die, but
she need not die of necessity; though I suppose there will be no help
for it. Good-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Darbyshire walked away in the direction of his house, where his
dinner was waiting: and Ben Rymer disappeared within doors, and
began to pound some rhubarb (or what looked like it) in a mortar.
He was pounding away like mad, with all the strength of his strong
hands, when who should come in but Lee. Lee had never been much
better than a shadow of late years, but you should have seen him now,
with his grey hair straggling about his meek, wan face. You should
have seen his clothes, too, and the old shoes, out at the toes and sides.
Burning people&rsquo;s letters was of course an unpardonable offence, not to
be condoned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamie said, sir, that you were good enough to tell her I was to
call in for some of the cough lozenges that did her so much good.
But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; interrupted Ben, getting down a box of the lozenges. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
let her spare them. They won&rsquo;t interfere with anything Mr. Darbyshire
may send. I hear he has been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But that those were not the days when beef-tea was sold in tins and
gallipots, Ben Rymer might have added some to the lozenges. As he
was handing the box to Lee, something in the man&rsquo;s wan and worn and
gentle face put him in mind of his late father&rsquo;s, whose heart Mr. Ben
had helped to break. A great pity took the chemist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would like to be reinstated in your place, Lee?&rdquo; he said
suddenly.</p>

<p>Lee could not answer at once, for the pain at his throat and the
moisture in his eyes that the notion called up. His voice, when he did
speak, was as hollow and mild as Mamie&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hope of that, sir. For a week after it was taken from
me, I thought of nothing else, night or day, but that Mr. Tanerton
might perhaps forgive me and get Salmon to put me on again. But
the time for hoping that went by: as you know, Mr. Rymer, they put
young Jelf in my place. I shall never forget the blow it was to me
when I heard it. The other morning I saw Jelf crossing that bit of
waste ground yonder with my old bag slung on his shoulder, and for a
moment I thought the pain would have killed me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is hard lines,&rdquo; confessed Ben.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have striven and struggled all my life long; only myself knows
how sorely, save God; and only He can tell, for I am sure I can&rsquo;t,
how I have contrived to keep my head any way above water. And
now it&rsquo;s under it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking the box, which Ben Rymer handed to him, Lee spoke a word
of thanks, and went out. He could not say much; heart and spirit
were alike broken. Ben called to his boy to mind the shop, and went
over to Salmon&rsquo;s. That self-sufficient man and prosperous tradesman
was sitting down at his desk in the shop-corner, complacently digesting
his dinner&mdash;which had been a good one, to judge by his red face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you manage to do something for Lee?&rdquo; began Ben, after
looking round to see that they were alone. &ldquo;He is at a rare low ebb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do something for Lee?&rdquo; repeated Salmon. &ldquo;What could I do for
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put him in his place again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say!&rdquo; Salmon laughed as he spoke, and then demanded
whether Ben was a fool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might do it if you would,&rdquo; said Ben. &ldquo;As to Lee, he won&rsquo;t
last long, if things continue as they are. Better give him a chance to
live a little longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now what do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Salmon. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
ask me to put a weathercock on yonder malthouse of Pashley&rsquo;s? Jelf
has got Lee&rsquo;s place, and you know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Jelf does not intend to keep it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Who says he does not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says it. He told me yesterday that he was sick and tired of
the tramping, and meant to resign. He only took it as a convenience,
whilst he waited for a clerkship he was trying for at a brewery at
Worcester. And he is to get that with the new year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what does Jelf mean by talking about it to others before he
has spoken to me?&rdquo; cried Salmon, going into a temper. &ldquo;He thought to
leave me and the letters at a pinch, I suppose! I&rsquo;ll teach him better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may teach him anything you like, if you&rsquo;ll put Lee on again.
I&rsquo;ll go bail that he won&rsquo;t get smoking again on his rounds. I think it
is just a toss-up of life or death to him. Come! do a good turn for
once, Salmon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Salmon paused. He was not bad-hearted, only self-important.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would Mr. Tanerton say to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben did not answer. He knew that there, after Salmon himself,
was where the difficulty would lie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All that you have been urging goes for nonsense, Rymer. Unless
the Rector came to me and said, &lsquo;You may put Lee on again,&rsquo; I should
not, and could not, attempt to stir in the matter; and you must know
that as well as I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t somebody see Tanerton, and talk to him? One would think
that the sight of Lee&rsquo;s face would be enough to soften him, without
anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;d like to do it,&rdquo; returned Salmon. And there
the conference ended, for the apprentice came in from his dinner.</p>

<p>Very much to our surprise, Mr. Ben Rymer walked in that same
evening to Crabb Cot, and was admitted to the Squire. In spite of
Mr. Ben&rsquo;s former ill-doings, which he had got to know of, the Squire
treated Ben civilly, in remembrance of his father, and of his grandfather,
the clergyman. Ben&rsquo;s errand was to ask the Squire to intercede for
Lee with Herbert Tanerton. And the pater, after talking largely about
the iniquity of Lee, as connected with burnt letters, came round to
Ben&rsquo;s way of thinking, and agreed to go to the Rectory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herbert Tanerton&rsquo;s harder than nails, and you&rsquo;ll do no good,&rdquo;
remarked Tod, watching us away on the following morning; for the
pater took me with him to break the loneliness of the walk. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
turn as cold to you as a stone the moment you bring up the subject, sir.
Tell me I&rsquo;m a story-teller when you come back if he does not, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We took the way of the Ravine. It was a searching day; the wintry
wind keen and &ldquo;unkind as man&rsquo;s ingratitude.&rdquo; Before us, toiling up
the descent to the Ravine at the other end, and coming to a halt at the
stile to pant and cough, went a woebegone figure, thinly clad, which
turned out to be Lee himself. He had a small bundle of loose sticks
in his hand, which he had come to pick up. The Squire was preparing
a sort of blowing-up greeting for him, touching lighted matches and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
carelessness, but the sight of the mild, starved grey face disarmed him;
he thought, instead, of the days when Lee had been a prosperous farmer,
and his tone changed to one of pity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard times, I&rsquo;m afraid, Lee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, very hard. I&rsquo;ve known hard times before, but I never
thought to see any so cruel as these. There&rsquo;s one comfort, sir; when
things come to this low ebb, life can&rsquo;t last long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stuff,&rdquo; said the Squire. &ldquo;For all you know, you may be back in
your old place soon: and&mdash;and Mrs. Todhetley will find some sewing
when Mamie&rsquo;s well enough to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A faint light, the dawn of hope, shone in Lee&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Oh, sir, if it
could be! and I heard a whisper to-day that young Jelf refuses to keep
the post. If it had been anybody&rsquo;s letter but Mr. Tanerton&rsquo;s, perhaps&mdash;but
he does not forgive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way now to ask him,&rdquo; cried the pater, unable to keep
in the news. &ldquo;Cheer up, Lee&mdash;of course you&rsquo;d pass your word not to
go burning letters again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d not expose myself to the danger, sir. Once I got my old place
back, I would never take out a pipe with me on my rounds; never, so
long as I live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Leaving him with his new hope and the bundle of firewood, we
trudged on to the Rectory. Herbert and Grace were both at home,
and glad to see us.</p>

<p>But the interview ended in smoke. Tod had foreseen the result
exactly: the Rector was harder than nails. He talked of &ldquo;example&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Christian duty;&rdquo; and refused point-blank to allow Lee to be
reinstated. The Squire gave him a few sharp words, and flung out of
the house in a passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pretty Christian <em>he</em> is, Johnny! He was cold and hard as a
boy. I once told him so before his stepfather, poor Jacob Lewis; but
he is colder and harder now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the turning of the road by Timberdale Court, we came upon Lee.
After taking his faggots home, he waited about to see us and hear the
news. The pater&rsquo;s face, red and angry, told him the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hope for me, sir, I fear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; growled the Squire. &ldquo;Mr. Tanerton won&rsquo;t listen
to reason. Perhaps we can find some other light post for you, my poor
fellow, when the winter shall have turned. You had better get indoors
out of this biting cold; and here&rsquo;s a couple of shillings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So hope went clean out of Andrew Lee.</p>

<hr class="l3" />

<p>Christmas Day and jolly weather. Snow on the ground to one&rsquo;s
heart&rsquo;s content. Holly and ivy on the walls indoors, and great fires
blazing on the hearths; turkeys, and plum-puddings, and oranges, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
fun. <em>That</em> was our lucky state at Crabb Cot and at Timberdale
generally, but not at Andrew Lee&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The sweet bells were chiming people out of church, as was the
custom at Timberdale on high festivals. Poor Lee sat listening to them,
his hand held up to his aching head. There had been no church for
him: he had neither clothes to go in nor face to sit through the service.
Mamie, wrapped in an old bed-quilt, lay back on the pillow by the fire.
The coal-merchant, opening his heart, had sent a sack each of best
Staffordshire coal to ten poor families, and Lee&rsquo;s was one. Except the
Squire&rsquo;s two shillings, he had had no money given to him. A loaf of
bread was in the cupboard; and a saucepan of broth, made of carrots
and turnips out of the garden, simmered on the trivet; and that would
be their Christmas dinner.</p>

<p>Uncommonly low was Mamie to-day. The longer she endured this
famished state of affairs the weaker she grew; it stands to reason. She
felt that a few days, perhaps hours, would finish her up. The little ones
were upstairs with their grandmother, so that she had an interval of
rest; and she lay back, her breath short and her chest aching as she
thought of the past. Of the time when James West, the handsome
young man in his gay regimentals, came to woo her, as the soldier did
the miller&rsquo;s daughter. In those happy days, when her heart was light
and her song blithe as a bird&rsquo;s in May, that used to be one of her songs,
&ldquo;The Banks of Allan Water.&rdquo; Her dream had come to the same
ending as the one told of in the ballad, and here she lay, deserted and
dying. Timberdale was in the habit of prosaically telling her that she
had &ldquo;brought her pigs to a fine market.&rdquo; Of the market there could
be no question; but when Mamie looked into the past she saw more of
romance there than anything else. The breaking out of the church
bells forced a rush of tears to her heart and eyes. She tried to battle
with the feeling, then turned and put her cheek against her father&rsquo;s
shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, father!&rdquo; she besought him, in a sobbing whisper. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think it will be long now; I want you to say you forgive me
before I go. If&mdash;if you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the words finished up for Lee what the bells had only partly
done. He broke down, and sobbed with his daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never thought there was need of it, or to say it, child; and if
there had been&mdash;Christ forgave all. &lsquo;Peace on earth and goodwill to
men.&rsquo; The bells are ringing it out now. He will soon take us to Him.
Mamie, my forlorn one: forgiven; yes, forgiven; and in His beautiful
world there is neither hunger, nor disgrace, nor pain. You are dying
of that cold you caught in the autumn, and I shan&rsquo;t be long behind
you. There&rsquo;s no longer any place for me here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not of the cold, father; I am not dying of that, but of a broken
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span></p>

<p>Lee sobbed. He did not answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I should like to leave my forgiveness to James, should he ever
come back here,&rdquo; she whispered: &ldquo;and&mdash;and my love. Please tell
him that I&rsquo;d have got well if I could, if only for the chance of seeing
him once again in this world; and tell him that I have thought all
along there must be some mistake; that he did not mean deliberately
to harm me. I think so still, father. And if he should notice little
Mima, tell him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A paroxysm of coughing interrupted the rest. Mrs. Lee came downstairs
with the children, asking if it was not time for dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The little ones are crying out for it, Mamie, and I&rsquo;m sure the rest
of us are hungry enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they bestirred themselves to take up the broth, and take seats
round the table. All but Mamie, who did not leave her pillow. Very
watery broth, the carrots and turnips swimming in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say grace, Andy,&rdquo; cried his grandmother.</p>

<p>For they kept up proper manners at Lee&rsquo;s, in spite of the short
commons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For what we are going to receive,&rdquo; began Andy: and then he
pulled himself up, and looked round.</p>

<p>Bursting in at the door, a laugh upon his face and a white basin in
his hands, came Mr. Ben Rymer. The basin was three parts filled
with delicious slices of hot roast beef and gravy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you might like to eat a bit, as it&rsquo;s Christmas Day,&rdquo; said
Ben. &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s an orange or two for you youngsters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pulling the oranges out of his pocket, and not waiting to be thanked,
Ben went off again. But he did not tell them what he was laughing at,
or the trick he had played his mother&mdash;in slicing away at the round of
beef, and rifling the dish of oranges, while her back was turned, looking
after the servant&rsquo;s doings in the kitchen, and the turning-out of the
pudding. For Mrs. Rymer followed Timberdale in taking an exaggerated
view of Lee&rsquo;s sins, and declined to help him.</p>

<p>Their faces had hardly done glowing with the unusual luxury of the
beef, when I dropped in. We had gone that day to church at Timberdale;
after the service, the Squire left the others to walk on, and,
taking me with him, called at the Rectory to tackle Herbert Tanerton
again. The parson did not hold out. How could he, with those bells,
enjoining goodwill, ringing in his ears?&mdash;the bells of his own church.
But he had meant to come round of his own accord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see Salmon about it to-morrow,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I did say just a
word to him yesterday. As you go home, Johnny may look in at
Lee&rsquo;s and tell him so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Johnny, if you don&rsquo;t mind carrying it, I&rsquo;ll send a drop of
beef-tea to Mamie,&rdquo; whispered Grace. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not dared to do it before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, when it was getting towards dusk, for the Squire stayed, talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
of this and that, there I was, with the bottle of beef-tea, telling Lee
the good news that his place would be restored to him with the new
year, and hearing about Ben Rymer&rsquo;s basin of meat. The tears rolled
down old Lee&rsquo;s haggard cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I had been fearing that God had abandoned me!&rdquo; he cried,
full of remorse for the doubt. &ldquo;Mamie, perhaps you can struggle on a
bit longer now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the greatest event of all was to come. Whilst I stood there,
somebody opened the door, and looked in. A tall, fine, handsome
soldier: and I did not at the moment notice that he had a wooden leg
from the knee downwards. Ben&rsquo;s basin of beef had been a surprise,
but it was nothing to this. Taking a glance round the room, it rested
on Mamie, and he went up to her, the smile on his open face changing
to concern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear lassie, what&rsquo;s amiss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;James!&rdquo; she faintly screamed; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s James!&rdquo; and burst into a fit
of sobs on his breast. And next the company was augmented by
Salmon and Ben Rymer, who had seen James West go by, and came
after him to know what it meant, and to blow him up for his delinquencies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mamie not married!&rdquo; laughed James. &ldquo;Timberdale has been
saying that? Why, what extraordinary people you must be! We
were married at Bristol&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve got the certificate in my knapsack at
Spicer&rsquo;s: I&rsquo;ve always kept it. You can paste it up on the church-door
if you like. Not married! Would Mamie else have gone with me, do
you suppose? Or should I have taken her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said poor Lee, thinking that heaven must have opened right
over his head that afternoon to shower down gifts, &ldquo;why did you not
marry her here openly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I could not get leave to marry openly. We soldiers
cannot marry at will, you know, Mr. Lee. I ought not to have done
it, that&rsquo;s a fact; but I did not care to leave Mamie, I liked her too
well; and I was punished afterwards by not being allowed to take her
to India.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never wrote, James,&rdquo; whispered Mamie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did, dear; I wrote twice to Ireland, not knowing you had
left it. That was at first, just after we landed. Soon we had a
skirmish with the natives out there, and I got shot in the leg and
otherwise wounded; and for a long time I lay between life and death,
only partly conscious; and now I am discharged with a pension and a
wooden leg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you can&rsquo;t go for a soldier again!&rdquo; cried Salmon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I. I shall settle at Timberdale, I think, if I can meet with a
pretty little place to suit me. I found my poor mother dead when I
came home, and what was hers is now mine. And it will be a comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
living for us, Mamie, of itself: besides a few spare hundred
pounds to the good, some of which you shall be heartily welcome to,
Mr. Lee, for you look as if you wanted it. And the first thing I shall
do, Mamie, my dear, will be to nurse you back to health. Bless my
heart! Not married! I wish I had the handling of him that first set
that idea afloat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get well now, Mamie,&rdquo; I whispered to her. For she was
looking better already.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Master Johnny, perhaps I shall! How good God is to us!
And, James&mdash;James, this is the little one. I named her after you:
Jemima.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace on earth, and goodwill to men!&rdquo; cried old Lee, in his
thankfulness. &ldquo;The bells said it to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as I made off at last to catch up the Squire, the little Mima
was being smothered with kisses in her father&rsquo;s arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill towards
men!&rdquo; To every one of us, my friends, do the Christmas bells say it,
as Christmas Day comes round.</p>
